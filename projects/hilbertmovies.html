<h1>HilbertMoVieS</h1>
<p><tt>HilbertMoVieS</tt> (Hilbert schemes: Modern Views and Synergies)
is an <a href="https://weave-research.net/">NWO+DFG Weave project</a>,
led by
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/andkrugmath/">Andreas Krug</a>
and me.
Its goal is to <strong>study Hilbert schemes of points on curves and surfaces</strong>.

<h3>Abstract for a general audience</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mathematicians often want to classify things. When continuous parameters are involved,
  a classification takes the form of a moduli space: a shape that acts as a book-keeping device to describe and study the classification.
  Different points in the moduli space correspond to different objects, and the shape of the space gives insight into the classification.
  In this project we will extend the scope of the existing constructions, by allowing "quantum surfaces" and curves with additional symmetries as input.
  We will study these new objects using modern tools from category theory and representation theory.
  <!--
  <p>Moduli spaces are ubiquitous constructions in algebraic geometry. They describe classifications of objects when
  continuous parameters are involved. They are our most natural source of new algebraic varieties, constructed out of
  existing ones. Their geometric properties are reflected, and reflect upon, the properties of the objects used to define
  them. There are often connections to mathematical physics and representation theory, and they are a rich source of
  inspiration for new mathematical tools and questions.
  <p>In this project, we focus on Hilbert schemes of points on curves and surfaces, parameterizing how n points on a variety
  can move around and come together. These are some of the most tractable examples of moduli spaces of sheaves, and
  they form the starting point for understanding more complicated moduli spaces. We will study them using modern
  tools from category theory and representation theory, with the main novelty being the extension of the usual input in
  the constructions to
  <ul>
    <li>objects of a "quantum" (i.e., noncommutative) nature, or
    <li>objects having additional symmetries.
  </ul>
  <p>In these extended settings we aim to establish the suitable analogues of the foundational results in the classical case,
  relating to the structure and properties of these new moduli spaces. This leads to exciting synergies between different
  fields of mathematics, where these quantum or symmetric objects have been studied from other perspectives. We will
  moreover develop computational tools to facilitate the study of these moduli spaces, to build a firm foundation for
  future research in this area.
