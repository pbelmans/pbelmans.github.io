<h1>CatsiNCAGe</h1>
<p><tt>CatsINCAGe</tt> (Categories in Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry)
is an <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/nwo-talent-programme/projects-vidi">NWO Vidi project</a>,
led by <a href="https://pbelmans.ncag.info">me</a>.
Its goal is to <strong>study noncommutative deformations of (singular / stacky) surfaces and higher-dimensional varieties</strong>.
<p>More information can also be found on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.61686/RZKLF82806">NWO project page</a>.

<h3>Abstract for a general audience</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Some phenomena in algebraic geometry can only be explained by enlarging what is understood by a geometric shape. We have to allow noncommutativity, where the multiplication $ab$ is not necessarily equal to $ba$, in order to find the noncommutative (or quantum) shapes that describe certain aspects of reality. Physics is an important source of inspiration for this, where quantum mechanics is inherently noncommutative.
<p>The project proposes to (a) study known noncommutative surfaces from novel viewpoints (b) find new noncommutative shapes in higher dimensions and understand the interactions between ordinary shapes and quantum shapes.
