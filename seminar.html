<p>I also organised <a href="/teaching">several graduate student seminars</a>.

<h2>In Antwerp</h2>
<p>I co-organised the <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/rg/fundamental-mathematics/research/seminars/">weekly departmental seminar</a>, for which there is a <a href="http://sympa.ua.ac.be/sympa/info/antwerp-algebra-seminar">mailing list</a>.
<p>I also organised <a href="https://anagrams-seminar.github.io">ANAGRAMS</a>, a graduate student seminar, centered around the topics of (noncommutative) algebra and algebraic geometry.
