<h3>Experimental Mathematics Lab</h3>
<p>Together with Gabor Wiese I'm in charge of the <a href="https://math.uni.lu/eml">Experimental Mathematics Lab</a> at the University of Luxembourg.
On its webpage you can find lots of beautiful work done by students over the past 10+ years,
go check it out!

<h3>Upper Rhine and Tributaries Algebraic Geometry Seminar</h3>
<p>Together with several other universities which are loosely situated along the Upper Rhine
and its tributaries (hence the funny name)
we are organising a joint seminar.
For all information, see <a href="https://urtags.info">urtags.info</a>.
There are 3 meetings per year foreseen, twice in Strasbourg (which is centrally located)
and once in one of the other organising universities.
I hope to meet you there!

<h3>Classified Mathematics</h3>
<p>This was an outreach project that was implemented in 2021 and 2022,
and continues to this day.
For <a href="/uni.lu/classified-mathematics">more information one is referred to the dedicated page</a>.
