<h1 class="post-title">Quantum cohomology of partial flag varieties</h1>
<p>In the Wintersemester 2020&ndash;2021 we will run a seminar on quantum cohomology of partial flag varieties, introducing a second theme to the symphony which is the geometry of partial flag varieties (the first theme being the structure of the derived category, <a href="/teaching/exceptional-collections-2020">as discussed in the previous seminar</a>). The goal is to:
<ul>
  <li>introduce quantum cohomology, as a deformation of the usual cohomology of a variety using Gromov&ndash;Witten invariants;
  <li>describe methods to work with the quantum cohomology of partial flag varieties;
  <li>give structural results of the quantum cohomology of partial flag varieties, and understand their link to the structure of the derived category;
</ul>
with a view towards current research. For the majority of the time the previous seminar is <em>not</em> a prerequisite.
<p>We have a <a href="/assets/quantum-program.pdf">detailed program</a>.


<p><strong>Where?</strong> <em>to be determined</em>, likely via Zoom
<br><strong>When?</strong> <em>to be determined</em>, it starts when the semester starts (i.e. last week of October, or first week of November)
