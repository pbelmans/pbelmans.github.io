<h1 class="post-title">Quantum cohomology of partial flag varieties</h1>
<p>In the Wintersemester 2020&ndash;2021 we will run a seminar on quantum cohomology of partial flag varieties, introducing a second theme to the symphony which is the geometry of partial flag varieties (the first theme being the structure of the derived category, <a href="/teaching/exceptional-collections-2020">as discussed in the previous seminar</a>).

<p><strong>Where?</strong> <em>to be determined</em>
<br><strong>When?</strong> <em>to be determined</em>
