<h1 class="post-title">Exceptional collections for finite-dimensional algebras and partial flag varieties</h1>
<p>In the Sommersemester 2020 we will run a seminar on exceptional collections in representation theory, first discussing the general theory for finite-dimensional algebras, and then we focus on derived categories of partial flag varieties and the representation theory of algebraic groups. The goal is to
<ul>
  <li>get familiar with exceptional collections and their applications in algebra, algebraic geometry and representation theory
  <li>discuss them in the context of coherent sheaves, and study the conjecture that the derived category of a partial flag variety has a full exceptional collection
</ul>
<p>We have a <a href="/assets/exceptional-program.pdf">detailed program</a>.

<p><strong>Where?</strong> <del>The seminar room of the Max Planck Institute</del>, online.
<br><strong>When?</strong> Thursday, from 4 to 6. You can find the Zoom link on eCampus or Basis. Email me if you have trouble accessing this.

<p><strong>Any talks given by PhD students or postdocs are postponed to the Wintersemester, to leave more room for the graduate students' talks.</strong>
