<h1 class="post-title">Selected topics in representation theory: Hochschild (co)homology</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The goal of the course is to give an introduction to Hochschild (co)homology, focussing on its applications in <em>deformation theory</em> of algebras (and schemes), and the role of the <em>Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition</em> in all this. There will be three parts:
<ol>
  <li>Hochschild (co)homology for algebras
  <li>Hochschild (co)homology and derived categories
  <li>The Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition for schemes
</ol>
<p>The <strong><a href="/assets/hh-2018-notes.pdf">lecture notes</a></strong> of a previous installation of this course are available. All comments are welcome! They give a preview of what might be covered (which is not determined yet).
<p>There will be 1 lecture per week.

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>For the first part some basic knowledge of homological algebra is required, e.g. on the level of the first chapters of Weibel. For the second and third part we will need standard algebraic geometry, e.g. on the level of Hartshorne. Familiarity with derived categories will be helpful, and might be required even.
