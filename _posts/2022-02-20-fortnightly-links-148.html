  <li><p><a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/schroer/FD-Atlas.html">FD-Atlas</a> is a <em>big</em> survey-in-progress about finite-dimensional algebras, being written by Jan Schr√∂er. When I see something like the diagrams on pages 12&ndash;17 my fingers start to itch, as this looks like an ideal website project. Stay tuned for possible news (but don't expect anything any time soon!)
  <li><p><a href="http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/users/kasprzyk/research/pdf/dialogues.pdf">Gavin Brown, Tom Coates, Alessio Corti, Tom Ducat, Liana Heuberger, Alexander Kasprzyk: Computation and data in the classification of Fano varieties</a> is a really nice survey on the classification of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds. It's a great short read, and nicely explains various things that happen on <a href="http://www.grdb.co.uk/">grdb.co.uk</a>.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04195v1">Arend Bayer, Alexander Perry: Kuznetsov's Fano threefold conjecture via K3 categories and enhanced group actions</a> shows how to fix Kuznetsov's conjecture on the interesting components of certain Fano 3-folds, by showing that they are never equivalent but that they are related by a deformation. They way to prove this is really interesting, and I strongly recommend reading at least the introduction.
