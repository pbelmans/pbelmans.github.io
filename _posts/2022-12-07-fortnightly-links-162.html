  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14195v1">Hans Franzen: A Gelfand-MacPherson correspondence for quiver moduli</a> provides a <em>sweeping</em> generalisation of the fact that there exists an isomorphism of varieties $\operatorname{Gr}(k,n)//\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}^n\cong(\mathbb{P}^{k-1})^n//\operatorname{SL}_k$ (depending on some choice of stability condition). It says that a moduli space of quiver representations can be written in two ways as the quotient of a certain quiver Grassmannian. Cool!
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14665v1">Adam Topaz: Algebraic dependence and Milnor K-theory</a> proves that Milnor K-theory fully determines a field (in many situations). I'd love to have a discussion about how this is (not) surprising, for an absolute non-expert it in any case sounds like a wonderful statement.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16154v1">Laurent Manivel: A four-dimensional cousin of the Segre cubic</a> talks about generalising the Segre cubic to other (higher-dimensional) settings, and focuses on a 4-dimensional case. Don't forget to read Section 9 for some glimpse into the higher-dimensional cases.
