<p><a href="https://hardy.uhasselt.be/personal/vdbergh/Publications/michel_pub.html">Michel Van den Bergh</a> turned 60 last year, and as with all birthday conferences they had to be postponed. Because organising a large in-person event still seems very hard, the big conference is meant to take place September 2022, but on Monday next week we will have a <strong><a href="https://nc-shapes.info">halfway-event</a></strong>, with three online speakers:
<ul>
  <li>Yuri Manin, Quantisation in monoidal categories and quantum operads
  <li>Alexander Kuznetsov, Simultaneous categorical resolutions
  <li>Marco Gualtieri, From geometric quantization to noncommutative algebraic geometry
</ul>
<p>I'm very glad that we can have this small celebration in honour of Michel and his great work in (noncommutative) algebraic geometry!
