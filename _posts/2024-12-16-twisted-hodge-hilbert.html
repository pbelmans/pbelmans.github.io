<p>Last year I wrote about <a href="{% post_url 2023-09-13-new-paper-hochschild-hilbert %}">a paper Lie Fu, Andreas Krug, and I wrote</a>,
about computing the Hochschild cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points.
In this paper we conjectured that the identity
\[
  \sum_{n\geq 0}\sum_{p=0}^{2n}\sum_{q=0}^{2n}\mathrm{h}^{p,q}(\mathop{\rm Hilb}\nolimits^nS,{L}_n)x^py^qt^n
  =
  \prod_{k\ge 1}\prod_{p=0}^2\prod_{q=0}^2\left( 1-(-1)^{p+q}x^{p+k-1}y^{q+k-1}t^k\right)^{-(-1)^{p+q}\mathrm{h}^{p,q}(S,{L}^{\otimes k})}.
\]
holds.
It gives an expression of the twisted Hodge numbers of the line bundle $L_n$ on $\mathop{\rm Hilb}^nS$
induced from a line bundle $L$ on $S$,
in terms of the twisted Hodge numbers of the line bundles (plural!) $L^{\otimes k}$ on $S$.
The version without $\otimes k$ was a conjecture of Boissi√®re,
for which counterexamples had already been found.
<p>I was really happy to see that Lie Fu has found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09975"><strong>a proof of the conjecture</strong></a>!

<p>It is no secret that I like explicit implementations of results.
It's not too hard to implement this formula,
except that it is a little cumbersome to deal with all the data required for the formula,
because you might need many twisted Hodge diamonds of $S$.
<p>That's why I decided to take my implementation of the (at the time conjectural) formula from a few years back,
clean it up,
and package it together with various interesting surfaces and their twisted Hodge diamonds.
My preferred choice of $L$ is the anticanonical line bundle,
because then it computes the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition
of the Hochschild cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points.

<h3>Some examples</h3>
<p>One of the explicit examples we have computed in our joint paper is $\mathop{\rm Hilb}^2\mathbb{P}^2$.
This can now be easily recomputed as
{% highlight python %}
sage: from twisted_hilbert import *
sage: S = CompleteIntersectionSurface([], 3) # anticanonical twist
sage: TwistedHilbertSchemeDiamond(S, 2).as_parallelogram()

<p>Here we use the twisted Hodge diamonds of complete intersection surfaces,
as implemented by <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/twisted-hodge-ci"><code>twisted-hodge-ci</code></a>,
something implemented by Piet Glas and myself a few years back.
<p>Alternative examples are given by bielliptic surfaces,
which are discussed at length in our joint paper.
