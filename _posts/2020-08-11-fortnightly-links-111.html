<p>A belated fortnightly links, to be blamed on <a href="https://stacks.github.io/">SPONGE</a> (Stacks Project ONline Geometry workshop), which was a great experience!

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00700v1">Ugo Bruzzo, Daniel Hernandez Ruiperez, Alexander Polishchuk: Notes on fundamental algebraic supergeometry. Hilbert and Picard superschemes</a> discusses many aspects of supergeometry, in a language that I as an ordinary algebraic geometer can read fluently. This is great! This makes learning something about supergeometry much easier, because in my (very) limited experience most references usually do things quite ad-hoc for the purposes of said reference, without a global picture.

  <p><small>Time for someone to start a <em>Superstacks project</em>...

  <li><p><a href="https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~mwemyss/MainFile_for_web.pdf">Osamu Iyama, Michael Wemyss: Tits cone intersections and applications</a> seems to be a preprint of a book. A book containing some of the most beautiful mathematical pictures I have ever seen. Aside from the pretty pictures, it also has beautiful mathematics, elaborating on the recent work of the authors on relating tilting theory to birational geometry.
  <p>This looks like excellent material for a reading seminar.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02255v1">Kenta Ueyama: Derived categories of skew quadric hypersurfaces</a> proves the at first surprising result that $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{qgr}A)$ where $A$ is the quotient of a specific skew polynomial algebra by a central quadratic equation can have <em>more</em> exceptional objects than the derived category of a commutative quadric. In particular, these skew quadric hypersurfaces are not supposed to be deformations of ordinary quadrics! This is a very intriguing picture that I'd love to understand more.
</ul>

<p>This is a frustrating fortnightly links, because I would like to get to the bottom of all three references, but there is only so much time in a day...
