<p>This is a short post detailing some updates I have done to <a href="https://www.fanography.info"><strong>Fanography</strong></a>, as I presume not everyone is reading the <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/fanography/commits/master">commit log</a> on GitHub.

<ul>
  <li>various fixes of mistakes and typos
  <li>added special names, such as Gushel&ndash;Mukai 3-fold or Verra 3-fold
  <li>added alternative descriptions
  <li>added information on <a href="https://www.fanography.info/toric">toric Fano 3-folds</a>, so that table 12.8 of the Iskovskikh&ndash;Prokhorov book is now also contained in Fanography, including links to the <a href="http://www.grdb.co.uk/">Graded Ring Database</a>
</ul>

<p><ins>Update for the update</ins>: After having published this post I decided to buckle up and add links to the period sequences on <a href="http://www.grdb.co.uk/"><abbr title="Graded Rings Database">GRDB</abbr></a> and <a href="http://www.fanosearch.net/">Fanosearch</a>. Because the numbering changed and the numbering of rank 4 Fano 3-folds wasn't entirely consistent it was quite time-consuming, but it's there now.

<p>You can contribute too!

<ul>
  <li>Do you know more names for Fano 3-folds?
  <li>The <a href="https://www.fanography.info/explained">page explaining terminology</a> is woefully incomplete.
</ul>

<p>Is there anything else you would like to see, or could contribute yourself?
