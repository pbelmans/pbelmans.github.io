<p>Together with <a href="https://www.math.ru.nl/~vhoskins/">Vicky Hoskins</a> and <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~kool0009/">Martijn Kool</a>
we are organizing the 2025 edition of VBAC:
a <a href="http://vbac.wikidot.com/">conference series with a long-standing tradition</a>.
It is a 2-day workshop in Utrecht, <strong>May 14 and 15</strong>.
<p>There is a <a href="https://vbac-2025.ncag.info/">website with all information</a>,
including the registration form.
In the VBAC tradition,
we have slots for contributed talks, by younger participants.
There is some funding for younger participants too.
<p>I hope to see many of you there!
