<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06786v1">Mirko Mauri, Evgeny Shinder: Homological Bondal-Orlov localization conjecture for rational singularities</a> is a cool preprint showing that the essential surjectivity part of the Bondal&ndash;Orlov conjecture for resolutions of rational singularities holds, at least if one goes to the Grothendieck group (hence it is true homologically). Nifty!
  <li><p><a href="https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vonkjb/notes/Baskerville.pdf">Jan Vonk: Torsion on elliptic curves</a> is a set of lecture notes for a summer school. It takes the reader on a beautiful trip through the ages, and is a highly recommended read.
  <li><p><a href="https://ringtheory.herokuapp.com/">Database of Ring Theory</a> is an interactive repository of properties of rings and modules. Highly fun, and very useful when you're teaching. It's like an interactive version of an algebra version of Counterexamples in Topology.
