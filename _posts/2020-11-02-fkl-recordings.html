<p>The <a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/events/eventpages/felix-klein-lectures/fkl-2020-reineke/">Felix Klein Lectures</a> are over (they were great!), and all recordings and slides are available on the website.

<p>I want to thank Markus again, for giving such a great lecture series, which involved improvising through power and internet outages, and quarantine. Thanks also to Paul Wedrich for dealing with the on-site aspect of the lecture series (and hence improvising through power and internet outages).
