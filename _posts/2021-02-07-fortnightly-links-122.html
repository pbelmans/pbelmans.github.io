  <li><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-finally-prove-rational-tetrahedron-solutions-20210202/">Tetrahedron Solutions Finally Proved Decades After Computer Search</a> is a Quanta article about a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14232">recent preprint</a> of Kedlaya&ndash;Kolpakov&ndash;Poonen&ndash;Rubinstein on the full classification of tetrahedra with rational angles. The inclusion of this link is also a reminder to anyone reading these fortnightly links, but who are not yet aware of Quanta, that it is a really interesting magazine.

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12452">Michel Brion: Homogeneous varieties under split solvable algebraic groups</a> gives a modern proof of the full and modern proof of Rosenlicht's theorem that any variety which is homogeneous under a split solvable group is of the form $\mathbb{A}^n\times(\mathbb{A}\setminus\{0\})^m$ for (unique) integers $n,m\geq0$. The footnotes in this article alone make it worth the read!

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01455">Nitin Nitsure: My encounter with Seshadri and with the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem</a> is a nice account of Nitsure's memories of Seshadri, who sadly passed away last year.
