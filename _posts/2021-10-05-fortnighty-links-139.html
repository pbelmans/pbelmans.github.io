  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13358">Indranil Biswas, Jacques Hurtubise: Degenerations of bundle moduli</a> discusses how one of my favourite objects (namely the moduli space of rank $n$ bundles with fixed determinant on a smooth projective curve) degenerates when the curve acquires nodal singularities. Given the role that degenerations play in mirror symmetry, one could hope that this can be another step in understanding mirror symmetry for this super-interesting class of Fano varieties.
  <li><p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/">Lean community blog</a> is a new(ish) blog about what's happening in the Lean community. For more coherent and regular updates than what I occassionaly link to in fortnightly links, it's a good idea to keep track of this blog!
