{% include hodge.html %}

<p>As I was cleaning up things I ran into my print-out of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1895918">del Ba√±o: On the motive of moduli spaces of rank two vector bundles over a curve</a>, which I apparently printed on December 15, 2017. This marks the start of my interest in these moduli spaces (which have an extremely rich and beautiful history!) and I noticed I never really looked at Section 3. In this section the Hodge numbers for <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=578858">Seshadri's desingularisation</a> of $\mathrm{M}_C(2,\mathcal{O}_C)$ are computed, and I couldn't resist having a little fun with this.
<p>This is now implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/hodge-diamond-cutter/commit/5577470bb9e3bd7e173baf64bf60cad373fcfdc3">Hodge diamond cutter</a>. Mind that there are 2 minor typos in the formula in the paper, which one can quickly fix by looking at the statements of the results from which the corollary follows.
<p>One thing which I'd find interesting is to figure out what the derived category of this variety looks like. Or maybe one should rather look for the structure of a categorical crepant resolution.
<p>If we do it for Seshadri's resolution and $g=3$, it seems we get $4$ exceptional objects (which is reasonable from the index being 4), 2 copies of $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^2C)$ and then something which can only be categorical it seems, with Hochschild homology in degrees $-2,0,2$ of dimension $6,84,6$. But no copy of $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C)$. Maybe a better candidate can be found though! And I should probably look at what is known about intersection cohomology.
<p><ins>Added a little while after publishing this</ins>: In case you wish to play around with the intersection cohomology (which somehow should measure the size of a noncommutative crepant resolution), you can use
{% highlight python %}
def IE(g): 
  x = HodgeDiamond.x
  y = HodgeDiamond.y

  E = ((1-x^2*y)^g * (1-x*y^2)^g - (x*y)^(g+1) * (1-x)^g * (1-y)^g) / ((1-x*y) * (1-(x*y)^2)) - (x*y)^(g-1) / 2 * ((1-x)^g * (1-y)^g / (1-x*y) + (-1)^(g-1) * (1+x)^g * (1+y)^g / (1+x*y))
  return HodgeDiamond.from_polynomial(HodgeDiamond.R(E.subs(x=-x, y=-y)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p><del>Still, the picture isn't obvious to me, but at least copies of $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C)$ seem to be naturally present now.</del> The formula is taken from <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2099191">this paper</a> by the way.
<h3>A proposal</h3>
<p><ins>A little more playing gives a clear picture</ins>: the noncommutative crepant resolution $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathrm{M}_C(2,\mathcal{O}_C)$ looks like it might have a semiorthogonal decomposition of the form
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}
=
\begin{cases}
\langle\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathrm{pt}),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathrm{pt}),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathrm{pt}),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathrm{pt}),\\
\quad\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^2C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^2C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^2C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^2C),\\
\quad\ldots,\\
\quad\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{g/2}C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{g/2}C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{g/2}C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{g/2}C)\rangle
& g\equiv 0\bmod 2 \\
\langle\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C), \\
\quad\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^3C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^3C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^3C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^3C), \\
\quad\ldots,\\
\quad\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{(g-1)/2}C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{(g-1)/2}C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{(g-1)/2}C),
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^{(g-1)/2}C)\rangle
& g\equiv 1\bmod 2 \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
<p>So for $g$ even there are 4 copies of the derived category of even symmetric powers of $C$, for the powers $0,2,\ldots,g/2$, whilst for $g$ odd there are 4 copies of the derived category of odd symmetric powers of $C$, for the powers $1,3,\ldots,(g-1)/2$.
<p>For $g=2$ this is good, because we're considering a noncommutative crepant resolution of $\mathbb{P}^3$, which is just $\mathbb{P}^3$ itself and there are 4 exceptional objects. For $g=3$ the numbers suggest a semiorthogonal decomposition with just 4 copies of $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C)$. Can that be true?!
<p>We also see the index of the (singular) moduli space being 4 in this picture.
<p>What is odd is that for $g$ odd there are no exceptional objects in the decomposition. I somehow expect there to be some of them, as we are considering a conjectural noncommutative crepant resolution of a Fano variety, and for smooth Fanos we always have the structure sheaf as an exceptional object.
<p>So this is just some wild speculation, based on the following code:
{% highlight python %}
def conjecture(g):
    if g % 2 == 0: return (IE(g) - 4 * sum([symmetric_power(2*k, g) for k in range(g // 2)])).hochschild().is_zero()
    else: return (IE(g) - 4 * sum([symmetric_power(2*k + 1, g) for k in range(g // 2)])).hochschild().is_zero()

for g in range(2, 20):
    print(g, conjecture(g))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The idea is that the columns of the "intersection Hodge diamond" correspond to the Hochschild homology of a categorical crepant resolution. I don't know whether that makes sense though, it's just Sunday afternoon speculation.

<p><small>I should create documentation using <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> I guess. That should making the code easier I hope.
