<p>A little while ago I let my computer waste some electricity on computing the quantum spectra
of two exceptional Grassmannians.
For more on the quantum spectrum,
see <a href="{% post_url 2020-11-29-spectra-on-grassmannian %}">this blogpost for more information</a>.
<p>The exceptional Grassmannians are:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E7/3">E7/P3</a>, with Euler characteristic 2016
  <li><a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E7/5">E7/P5</a>, with Euler characteristic 4032
</ul>
<p>I believe slightly larger Grassmannians should also within reach, but the calculation,
which by no means was optimized,
did not finish on time.
Below you can see the largest quantum spectrum currently available on Grassmannian.info:
