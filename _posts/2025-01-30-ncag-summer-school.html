<p>This summer we are organizing a summer school in Antwerp, on noncommutative algebraic geometry
(more precisely: homological mirror symmetry, and the formalism of $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-categories).
It is organized with the help of SLMath, as an offshoot of last year's research semester on noncommutative algebraic geometry.
The application form for non-US citizens is now available,
and all information can be found on the <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-winter-schools/non-commutative-algebraic-geometry/">workshop's website</a>.
<p>Please share this with interested students.
The target audience is master students and early PhD students
with some background in the topic.
