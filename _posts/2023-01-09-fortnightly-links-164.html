<p>We're back with the regular scheduling after having taken the Christmas break off.
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stevejtrettel/status/1604865922929287173">Steve Trettel: Barth sextic in $\mathrm{S}^3$</a> is a beautiful visualisation of the Barth sextic, not in an affine patch but rather the double cover ramified in the Barth sextic restricted to $\mathrm{S}^3$ which does manage to capture all of geometry in a single chart.
    These pictures are <strong>stunning</strong>!
    I wish I could reproduce these and play around with some other surfaces, this is really super cool.
    <p>More tweets by Steve Trettel with similar pictures: <a href="https://twitter.com/stevejtrettel/status/1604865922929287173">tweet 1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stevejtrettel/status/1604894528481087488">tweet 2</a>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10638v1">James Hotchkiss: Hodge theory of twisted derived categories and the period-index problem</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12971">Aise Johan de Jong, Alexander Perry: The period-index problem and Hodge theory</a> are two preprints discussing the period-index problem using Hodge theory, the former on the categorical side, the latter in a more classical setting. They both look really interesting at first sight, and I'll read them a bit later this week or the next.
  <li><p><a href="https://perso.imj-prg.fr/olivier-debarre/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2022/12/On-rationality-problems-copie.pdf">Olivier Debarre: On rationality problems</a> are lecture notes on rationality questions in algebraic geometry. For a recent update on the state-of-the-art of this question, this is a very nice reference and introduction!
