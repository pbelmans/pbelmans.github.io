  <li><p><a href="https://thuses.com">Thuses</a> is a new online math platform, aimed at being a central hub for what otherwise would be interesting mathematical blogposts scattered all over personal blogs. But I guess the big takeaway is that most of the contributors would not start a personal blog, or if they did, they would never get the exposure they could now. Head over there for great content!

  <li><p><a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~hkrause/HomTheRep.pdf">Henning Krause: Homological theory of representations</a> is the (finished) draft of a book to be published soon, about the representation theory of associative algebras from a homological / categorical point of view. It's a great read, taking an abstract but not too abstract approach to things.

  <li><p><a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/presentation.phtml?option_lang=eng&presentid=30613">Alexander Kuznetsov: Categorical absorption of singularities and nodal nonfactorial Fano threefolds</a> is the video of a talk by Sasha, giving a preview of work-to-come with Evgeny Shinder. The streaming seems to be suboptimal because of the file size, so downloading it is maybe advised.

  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-6Tr2iVBLs">Ed Segal: Mirrors to surfaces and twisted derived categories</a> is another video, giving a preview of work of just Ed himself. What I liked so much about this talk is that it's the first instance of the derived Brauer group making an appearance in something "down-to-earth", namely what is the mirror to a certain punctured surface? Cool stuff!
  <p>This also serves as a reminder that the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/derivedseminar/schedule?authuser=0">Derived seminar</a> is a great event.
