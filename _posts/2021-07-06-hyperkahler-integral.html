<p>It's been a while since there was an honest mathematical blogpost, for <a href="{% post_url 2021-04-23-ida %}">reasons explained in an earlier post</a>. I should maybe also write something about the preprint we put on the arXiv in April.
<p>But today I will share you a fun computation I did involving hyperkähler varieties, as I expect that some of the code used in the computation will be useful to future me, and therefore maybe also to someone else.
<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/hyperkahler-integrals.pdf">the pdf for which this blogpost is an introduction</a>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/pbelmans/931580361e84b71789e826935f21d282">the Sage code</a>
</ul>

<h3>Hyperkähler varieties</h3>
<p>There is a curious class of varieties with trivial canonical bundle, which are irreducible holomorphic symplectic varieties, or hyperkähler varieties. For an excellent introduction one is referred to <a href="https://irma.math.unistra.fr/~pacienza/notes-ogrady.pdf">O'Grady's introductory lecture notes</a>.
<p>Up to deformation, we currently know of two infinite families and 2 exceptional (maybe sporadic is a better word? maybe they are not so sporadic too but we just don't know):
<ul>
  <li>Hilbert schemes of points on K3 surfaces
  <li>generalised Kummer varieties
  <li>O'Grady's 6-dimensional varieties
  <li>O'Grady's 10-dimensional varieties
</ul>
<p>Roughly there are 2 types of results on hyperkähler varieties:
<ul>
  <li>results proven for an abstract hyperkähler variety
  <li>results proven by inspecting the known cases explicitly
</ul>

<h3>On $\int\mathrm{td}_X^{1/2}$</h3>
<p>A very interesting cohomology class is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_class">Todd class</a>, which first appears when you look at the Hirzebruch&ndash;Riemann&ndash;Roch formula. It is also possible to take the square root of this class, and <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1813238">Hitchin&ndash;Sawon</a> proved that for a $2n$-dimensional hyperkähler variety $X$
\begin{equation}
\int\mathrm{td}_X^{1/2}
=
\frac{1}{(192\pi^2n)^n}
\frac{||R||^{2n}}{(\operatorname{vol}X)^{n-1}}
\end{equation}
<p>Here $||R||$ is the $\mathcal{L}^2$-norm of the Riemann curvature tensor. I don't claim I understand the right-hand side very well, but even without deep understanding the right-hand side exhibits beauty.

<p>For an abstract hyperkähler variety, the work of Hitchin&ndash;Sawon and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04685">Jiang</a> shows that
\begin{equation}
0 &lt; \int\mathrm{td}_X \leq 1
\end{equation}
with equality if and only if $X$ is a K3 surface.
<p>For the two known finite families on the other hand Sawon has given in his PhD thesis an explicit expression, namely
\begin{align}
\int\mathrm{td}_{\mathrm{K3}^{[n]}}&=\frac{(n+3)^n}{4^n n!}, \\
\int\mathrm{td}_{\mathrm{Kum}^n}&=\frac{(n+1)^{n+1}}{4^n n!}.
\end{align}
<p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04685v1"><strong>first</strong> version of Jiang's preprint</a> an exercise left to the reader was to compute these integrals for O'Grady's exceptional hyperkähler varieties, using the fact that the Chern numbers are known.
<p>Over the weekend I had some fun doing this in Sage, resulting in a <a href="/assets/hyperkahler-integrals.pdf">short note which could be of interest to someone</a>. The code is available in the pdf, but also as <a href="https://gist.github.com/pbelmans/931580361e84b71789e826935f21d282">a gist</a>. The numbers that I obtained led Jiang to update his preprint, giving a more conceptual explanation for them.
<p>There is no serious mathematics happening here, but I hope the very explicit nature and available code is of interest. I had fun making my first steps in hyperkähler varieties!
<p>For good measure, here is the output of the Sage code:
<pre><code>O'Grady 6-fold
Defining c2, c4, c6
2/3

O'Grady 10-fold
Defining c2, c4, c6, c8, c10
4/15

Generalised Kummer variety of dimension 6-fold: computation by hand
Defining c2, c4, c6
2/3</pre></code>
<p>I don't have the Chern numbers of the Hilbert scheme of 5 points on a K3 surface, so I couldn't do an explicit check for that case, but the closed formula of course just works too.
<p>And here's a table with some values
