<p>Lockdown is good for developing mathematical websites, I guess. I've pushed another update to <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info"><strong>grassmannian.info</strong></a>: it now shows some basic information about the derived categories of generalised Grassmannians, namely when it is known that a full exceptional collection exists. An important folklore conjecture states that this is the case, but as you can see when you enable the coloring in the table, we are still a long way off of settling it.

<p>What I never realised is that, out of all known cases, <strong>only one</strong> is not (co)minuscule or (co)adjoint. These are somehow the easiest varieties, and for the majority of them (see below) a full exceptional collection is known. The unique example outside this class is constructed by Guseva in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07777">On the derived category of $\mathrm{IGr}(3,8)$</a> (denoted $\mathrm{SGr}(3,8)$ on <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info">grassmannian.info</a>.

<p>Out of the (co)minuscule or (co)adjoint varieties, the ones for which an exceptional collection is not yet constructed are:
<ul>
  <li>the (co)adjoint in type E<sub>6</sub>: <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E6/2">E<sub>6</sub>/P<sub>2</sub></a>
  <li>the (co)minuscule in type E<sub>7</sub>: <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E7/7">the Freudenthal variety, or E<sub>7</sub>/P<sub>7</sub></a>
  <li>the (co)adjoint in type E<sub>7</sub>: <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E7/1">E<sub>7</sub>/P<sub>1</sub></a>
  <li>the (co)adjoint in type E<sub>8</sub>: <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E8/8">E<sub>8</sub>/P<sub>8</sub></a>
  <li>the adjoint in type F<sub>4</sub>: <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/F4/1">F<sub>4</sub>/P<sub>1</sub></a>
</ul>
<p>If you manage to construct an exceptional collection in one of these cases, I will give you a large bar of your preferred Belgian chocolate, if you need some further incentive to think about it.

<p><small>I've also completed copying the information from Bourbaki's appendix.</small>
