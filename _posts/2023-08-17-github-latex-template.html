<p>For the impatient and tech-savvy: go and check out <strong><a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/latex-template">this GitHub template repository</a></strong>.

<p>Last week during the Stacks project workshop I gave an <a href="https://stacks.github.io/2023-git.pdf">introduction to Git for working mathematicians</a>,
and one thing that people found interesting then was my GitHub LaTeX template,
which includes:
<ul>
  <li>a GitHub Action to build pdf's upon push, see <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/latex-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/pdf.yml">pdf.yml</a>
  <li>hooks to add commit metadata to pdf's
</ul>
<p>The first thing is the coolest I think,
and a variation upon existing such actions that are available on GitHub already.
It guarantees that there is always a copy of the pdf in the repository,
except that it lives in an orphan branch where it cannot create conflicts!

<p>I've now put this on GitHub as a <strong><a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/latex-template">template repository</a></strong>,
so that you can just click the green <strong>Use this template</strong> button
to start a new repository from scratch, with this configuration.

<p>
<p>Is there something missing, or unclear? Let me know!
<p>I also have some inspiration to write a "<em>Git and GitHub for working mathematicians</em>" tutorial,
there exist excellent introductions already,
but I think there needs to be one which doesn't mention the commandline <em>at all</em>.
Stay tuned for that!
