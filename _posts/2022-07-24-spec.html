<p>Earlier this week we (= <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~weiho/">Wei Ho</a>, <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/">Johan de Jong</a> and I) sent the final version of <strong><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/stacks-project-expository-collection/433A8B918FB8FD11AA0E82C3E24E5B2D">Stacks Project Expository Collection</a></strong> to the publisher.
It is a collection of expository articles on modern topics in algebraic geometry (often featuring something stacky)
written by groups participating in the Stacks project workshops in 2017 and 2020.
It will be published by Cambridge University Press in the London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series, number 480.

<p>The table of contents, with links to preprints whenever available is:

<p>We are grateful to CUP for allowing the posting of these preprint versions of individual chapters, and for the opportunity to publish this book in the first place!
