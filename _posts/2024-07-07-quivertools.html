<h2>QuiverTools</h2>
<p>I am really excited to announce something that has been in the making for quite some time, and which is the result of the hard work with
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://math.uni-paderborn.de/ag/arbeitsgruppe-algebra/team/hans-franzen">Hans Franzen</a>
  <li><a href="https://giannipetrella.eu">Gianni Petrella</a>
</ul>

<p>Many questions in the representation theory and algebraic geometry of quivers and their moduli of representations
can be answered using very algorithmic methods.
This is what <a href="https://quiver.tools"><strong>QuiverTools</strong></a> is about.
We do not deal with actual representations (that is what <a href="https://folk.ntnu.no/oyvinso/QPA/">QPA</a> is for),
rather our focus is on the geometry of moduli spaces.

<h3>An example</h3>
Let us illustrate some things.
One of my favourite quiver moduli is the 6-dimensional Kronecker moduli space,
which Hans and I considered in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/imrn/rnad306">On Chow rings of quiver moduli</a>.
Let us define it in QuiverTools:
{% highlight python %}
from quiver import *

Q = KroneckerQuiver(3)
X = QuiverModuliSpace(Q, (2, 3))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Then we can compute some of its basic invariants as follows:
{% highlight python %}
X.is_projective() # True
X.is_smooth() # True
X.dimension() # 6
X.picard_rank() # 1
X.index() # 3
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Just like in the Hodge diamond cutter you can compute Betti numbers:
{% highlight python %}
X.betti_numbers() # [1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1]
{% endhighlight %}
<p>We also support the recent work involving Chow rings and rigidity questions for quiver moduli:
{% highlight python %}
eta = -Q.canonical_stability_parameter(d) / 3
X.degree(eta) # 57

X.if_rigidity_inequality_holds() # True
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This is only a very quick tour of what it can do, more explanations are to come!
<p>If you have problems installing it, you can also run it inside your browser using <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/QuiverTools/mybinder-sage/master">this interactive binder notebook</a>.

<h3>Some comments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This release is really only a <code>v1.0</code>.
    Let us know if you find issues, or have feature requests!
  <li>We are also working on a Julia version, focusing more on performance.
    Stay tuned for more information.
  <li>We are also working on more detailed instructions:
    for now there is the documentation taken from the docstrings,
    which should be good enough if you have some experience with Sage and quiver moduli,
    but a more user-friendly guide is in the works.
</ul>
