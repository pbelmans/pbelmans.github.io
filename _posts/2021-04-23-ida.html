<p>Here's an important real-life update: last week our daughter Ida was born. All is well with her, and with the two (slightly sleep-deprived) people who do their best to keep her in good health.
<p>There will be slightly less blog activity (and programming in particular), but the fortnightly links will return this Sunday. Given how little space is otherwise dedicated to personal updates on this blog I think I'll just leave it at this :).
