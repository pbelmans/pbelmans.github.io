<p>A quick update on the fun project <strong><a href="https://www.grassmannian.info">grassmannian.info</a></strong> that I introduced <a href="{% post_url 2020-05-08-grassmannian-info %}">last week</a>: every Grassmannian now has its own page, with specific information. Some examples:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/A3/2">the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/D5/5">the 10-dimensional spinor variety</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E6/1">the Cayley plane</a>
</ul>

<p>Of course, this is far from a complete overview of possible information. Some things I have already planned:
<ul>
  <li>properties of the dual variety (and other aspects of projective duality)
  <li>existence of full exceptional collections
  <li>structure of Lefschetz collections
  <li>properties of the homological projective dual
  <li>the Freudenthal magic square
</ul>
<p>Aside from this, I should of course improve the interface of the periodic table itself. And write explanations for what is currently on there.

<p><strong>Suggestions are very welcome!</strong> What do you want to see?
