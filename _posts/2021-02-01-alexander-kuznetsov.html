<p>This morning we woke up to the horrible news that <a href="http://www.mi-ras.ru/~akuznet/">Alexander Kuznetsov</a> and his daughter were arrested after protests in Moscow. A petition has been started, let me simply quote the message that Richard Thomas sent on the EAGER and COW mailing lists:

<blockquote>
  <p>The algebraic geometer Alexander Kuznetsov -- winner of the European Mathematical Society prize of 2008 -- has been arrested for peacefully protesting the detention of Alexey Navalny.
  <p>A petition asking for his release is here <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/free-alexander-kuznetsov">Free Alexander Kuznetsov</a>. The more people sign, the more impact it will have in the Russian press.
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update</strong>, taken from the petition website:

<blockquote>
  <p>Sasha's trial has been postponed until Wednesday; he has been released until then. His daughter has been released with a fine. Please continue to sign to express solidarity with all the mathematics students and members of the public who are also detained.
</blockquote>
