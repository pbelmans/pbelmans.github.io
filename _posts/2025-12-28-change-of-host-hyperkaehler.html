<p>I've been hosting all interactive websites on PythonAnywhere,
but recently I felt the urge to try and host them on my Synology DS920+.
Four years ago, I bought it with the possibility in mind
of starting to self-host various things
aside from using it as a NAS.
After a failed attempt a few weeks ago
(despite port forwarding being set up in a seemingly correct fashion,
my ISP was blocking communication with the Let's Encrypt servers)
I figured out that I could use CloudFlare Tunnels instead.
<p>I have now done this for <a href="https://hyperkaehler.info">Hyperkaehler.info</a>,
as a little experiment.
You shouldn't notice anything different,
except that response times might even be a little quicker,
and the SSL certificate comes from somewhere else.
But in case it does go down for a prolonged period,
now you know why.
<p>If this approach works well for the next few months,
I'll probably move my other interactive websites over as well
(the static ones can simply continue running via GitHub Pages for the time being)
