  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06587">Amnon Neeman: Finite approximations as a tool for studying triangulated categories</a> is a contribution to the ICM proceedings, and a highly recommended read. The writing is delightful, switching between highly abstract category theory, algebraic geometry and down-to-earth analogues of those abstract results.
  <li><p><a href="https://francisrlb.wordpress.com/2022/11/14/characters-brackets-and-skeins/">Francis Bischoff: Characters, Brackets, and Skeins</a> is an interesting blogpost on character varieties, with beautiful pictures to illustrate the subject. Cool!

    <p><small>I wish there were more mathbloggers. I should probably do more serious mathblogging too, but alas.</small>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07998v1">Andreas Demleitner: The classification of hyperelliptic groups in dimension 4</a> is a monumental classification of analogues of bielliptic surfaces, but now in dimension 4.

    <p>I wonder what can be done with their derived categories: they don't seem to be indecomposable necessarily? I (or someone else) should probably check the Kawatani&ndash;Okawa, Lin and Caucci indecomposability criteria more carefully here.
