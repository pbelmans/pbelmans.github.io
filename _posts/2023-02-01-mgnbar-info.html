<p>Together with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ibarros/">Ignacio Barros</a> we have created <strong><a href="https://mgnbar.info">Mgnbar.info</a></strong>,
a website dedicated to the geometry of $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_{g,n}$, the moduli space of stable marked curves.
<h2>Kodaira dimension of $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_{g,n}$</h2>
<p>Our initial goal was to reproduce a static table that Ignacio had made and which is still available at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ibarros/state-of-art-mgn?authuser=0">his homepage</a>, that gives the Kodaira dimension of these moduli spaces.
<p>The reason why this is so interesting is that we've known for more than a hundred years that $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_g$ had Kodaira dimension $-\infty$ (because it is rational) for $g=2,\ldots,10$, by Severi. But then in 1982 Harris and Mumford showed that $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_{25}$ (and $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_g$ for all further odd $g$) are of general type! This was later shown to hold for all $g\geq 24$, and in 2020 for all $g\geq 22$. On the other side we now know that for $g\leq15$ it has Kodaira dimension $-\infty$, and $g=16$ is not of general type.
<p>So there is a drastic change in the complexity of these moduli spaces when you vary $g$. And when you start adding in markings on your curve a similar picture arises, but the change starts happening sooner the more marked points you add.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Well, that's for you to decide! Right now it's just a showcase of what is possible, with basic interface for Kodaira dimension.
<p>You can make suggestions on <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/mgnbar/issues">GitHub issues</a>, or send me an email. Please be detailed in what you are suggesting, and include ample references, as I'm no expert.
