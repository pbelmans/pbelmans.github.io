  <li><p><a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~danielhl/modern_moduli_theory.pdf">Daniel Halpern-Leistner: Moduli theory</a> are lecture notes by one of the leading figures in the recent developments in the geometry of moduli spaces and stacks. If you are looking for examples or exercises related to some cutting edge results in algebraic stacks (e.g. the Ã©tale-local structure, good moduli spaces, or $\Theta$-stratifications), look no further!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07618v1">Maurice Chayet, Skip Garibaldi: A class of continuous non-associative algebras arising from algebraic groups including E8</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02625v1">Tom De Medts, Michiel Van Couwenberghe: Non-associative Frobenius algebras for simply laced Chevalley groups</a> are two papers whose most striking result is the explicit construction of a non-associative algebra whose automorphism group is the algebraic group of type $\mathrm{E}_8$. Such construction was known for the exceptional type $\mathrm{G}_2$ for over a 100 years, but as is usual, $\mathrm{E}_8$ takes a little longer to settle. Cool!
