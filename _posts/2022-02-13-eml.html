<p>One of the things I do <a href="{% post_url 2021-08-04-luxembourg %}">since I started</a> at the University of Luxembourg is help organising the <a href="https://math.uni.lu/eml/">Experimental Mathematics Lab</a>. It is a way of promoting and coordinating anything that can be considered experimental mathematics, and it mostly concerns a series of projects courses in the bachelor's programme, but it also includes bachelor and master theses, and students projects in the master's programme.
<p>At some point we will hopefully also have a physical manifestation of the lab, right now it's purely virtual.
<p>There's a long history, and you can see some of the highlights in the <a href="https://math.uni.lu/eml/gallery/">gallery</a>.

<p>All this to say, that:
