<p>Today in my arXiv reading I came across <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10589">Bradley Doyle: Homological Projective Duality for the Pl√ºcker embedding of the Grassmannian</a>, and in Section 1.4 there were some comments about the interesting component of a linear section of a Grassmannian that piqued my interest.

<p>I decided to have some fun with more general cases. In type A the following are low-dimensional and possibly of interest:
<ul>
  <li>$\operatorname{Gr}(4,8)$ does not give a Calabi&ndash;Yau category in the hyperplane section, but it can be computed that $\dim\operatorname{HH}_{\pm1}=3$.
  <li>$\operatorname{Gr}(4,9)$ gives a Calabi&ndash;Yau category of dimension 3 in the hyperplane section, with the middle cohomology of the hyperplane section having dimensions $1,45,45,1$.
  <p>$\operatorname{Gr}(3,11)$ gives another Calabi&ndash;Yau category of dimension 3 in the hyperplane section, with the middle cohomology of the hyperplane section having dimensions $1,44,44,1$.
</ul>
<p>It turns out that the latter two cases are already mentioned in Section 4.5 of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3987870">Alexander Kuznetsov: Calabi-Yau and fractional Calabi-Yau categories</a>.

<p>For good measure I decided to compute some more middle cohomology of hyperplane sections of orthogonal and symplectic Grassmannians, and see where it could be of interest. Here's a quick overview (hopefully without mistakes now):

<p>Some comments on the table:
<ul>
  <li><p>By Corollary 4.5 of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3987870">Alexander Kuznetsov: Calabi-Yau and fractional Calabi-Yau categories</a> we know that the interesting component of $\operatorname{OGr}(2,2n+1)$ is a Calabi&ndash;Yau category of dimension 0, so we get that the homological projective dual should be a finite cover of the dual projective space ramified along the classical projective dual.
  <li><p>The reader of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3987870">Alexander Kuznetsov: Calabi-Yau and fractional Calabi-Yau categories</a> is left to formulate analogous results for hyperplane sections (and hypersurfaces of low degree) in other generalised Grassmannians. The data from the table will be a good consistency check. These will be partially conjectural (lacking a construction of the required Lefschetz collections), and they might be complicated by the fact that the Lefschetz collections aren't necessarily rectangular. So maybe the Calabi&ndash;Yauness mentioned above is only correct for some subcategory.
</ul>

<p>I fully expect various of these to be known (or conjectured) before. But my memory is not the best, so I guess I need to include an overview of what is known on <a href="https://grassmannian.info">Grassmannian.info</a>, also known as my external memory.

<p>Update October 23: <ins datetime="2021-10-23">Sasha Kuznetsov pointed out some issues in the original version of the table. I would like to thank him for this!</ins>

<p>Update October 25: <ins datetime="2021-10-25">Enrico Fatighenti pointed out that the $1,44,44,1$ appearing in both the hyperplane sections of $\operatorname{Gr}(4,9)$ and $\operatorname{SGr}(3,10)$ is not a coincidence. Indeed, in <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=4225029">Nested varieties of K3 type</a> it is shown that there is a Hodge-theoretic relationship between these hyperplane sections. It is still open to extend this to an equivalence of residual categories, if anyone is up for a challenge!</ins>
