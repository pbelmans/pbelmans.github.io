<p>I doubt this post is relevant to the readers of this blog,
but maybe you are supervising or advising someone for whom it is useful.
I am not an expert on these things,
but it seems that there are some upcoming deadlines
for <a href="https://www.uni.lu/life-en/financial-support/scholarships/">scholarships at the University of Luxembourg</a>,
which thus could be of some interest to people who want to come and study at our university.
<p>Please spread the word!
