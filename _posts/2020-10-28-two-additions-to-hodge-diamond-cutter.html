{% include hodge.html %}

<p>Just a quick service announcement: I have now added Hodge diamonds for
<ul>
  <li>the Fano varieties of $i$-dimensional linear subspaces on the intersection of $Q_1\cap Q_2\subset\mathbb{P}^{2g}$
  <li>the Grothendieck&ndash;Knudsen moduli space $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ of stable $n$-pointed rational curves
</ul>
<p>The first case, for $i=g-2$, is also the moduli space discussed in <a href="{% post_url 2020-10-26-canonical-strips-moduli-bundles %}">the previous post</a>.
<p>The usual comment applies: feel free to suggest other varieties whose Hodge diamonds you would like to be implemented!
