<p>It's no secret I like
<ul>
  <li>making websites
  <li>classification results
</ul>
<p>and one classification I found myself going back to over and over again is that of Fano 3-folds. These are smooth projective varieties of dimension 3 such that the anticanonical bundle $\omega_X^\vee$ is ample. These have been classified by Iskovskikh and Mori&ndash;Mukai. It turns out there are 105 different families, with interesting relationships between them.

<p>At <a href="https://www.fanography.info"><strong>fanography.info</strong></a> I've created an online tool to study this classification, combining information from quite a few different sources.

<p>There are still some things I would like to add, such as
<ul>
  <li>more information on the minimal model program: extremaly rays, birational transformations
  <li>semiorthogonal decompositions
  <li>K-stability
  <li>dimensions of the automorphism groups
  <li>information on toric geometry
  <li>information on mirror symmetry
</ul>
<p>but I guess it's better to just release it as it is, instead of waiting for me to finish this.
<p>If you want to contribute by <em>adding information</em> or <em>adding explanations</em>, please get in touch!
