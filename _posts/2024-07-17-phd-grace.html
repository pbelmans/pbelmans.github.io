<p>The Department of Mathematics at the University of Luxembourg has <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/24824"><strong>8 open positions</strong></a>, as part of a project in fundamental mathematics with a significant computational and experimental twist. All information on how to apply can be found there.
<p>The earliest starting date for any of the positions is late 2024. I do not necessarily plan to fill the position attached to my part of the project as early as possible, spring or summer of 2025 is more likely, but you can certainly express your interest in working with me.
