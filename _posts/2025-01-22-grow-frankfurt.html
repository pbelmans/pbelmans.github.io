<p>Following a great tradition of US-based <em>Graduate Research Opportunities for Women</em> workshops,
we <a href="{% post_url 2022-02-11-grow-at-bonn %}">organized a similar event in Bonn back in 2022</a>,
with editions in 2023 and 2024 that I seemingly did not advertise using blogposts.
There is <a href="https://www.imsi.institute/grow/">somewhat of a franchise behind it now</a>.
<p>I am now no longer an organizer on the European side,
but I am happy to spread the word that the 2025 edition is taking place in Frankfurt.

<p>As before, I fully expect that the average reader of this blog is not in the target audience of the workshop, but if you are supervising students in the target demographic, please pass along the message!
