<p>We are <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/19929">hiring a new associate / full professor in mathematics at the University of Luxembourg</a>. It is open to all areas of mathematics, but of course it would be great to strengthen the department with someone with algebraic or geometric interests!
<p>If you have any questions, you can just ask me.
