  <li><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01627-2">Mathematicians welcome computer-assisted proof in ‘grand unification’ theory</a> is the continuation of the previous fortnightly links' theme about the Liquid Tensor Experiment. They've made it to Nature now!

  <li><p><a href="https://www.jgibson.id.au/lievis/">Lie theory visualisations</a> are beautiful interactive webpages by Joel Gibson, making representation theory of Lie algebras / algebraic groups super attractive. Please use these in your teaching if you can!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04857">Kyoung-Seog Lee, Han-Bom Moon: Positivity of the Poincaré bundle on the moduli space of vector bundles and its applications</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04872">Kyoung-Seog Lee, M. S. Narasimhan: Symmetric products and moduli spaces of vector bundles of curves</a> continues a story I find very attractive (having worked on it myself) about semiorthogonal decompositions of the moduli space of vector bundles. It is shown that the derived category of the curve always embeds (for $g\gg 2$) for all coprime ranks and degrees (Swarnava and I had it for all ranks and degree equal to 1 modulo the rank) and that the derived category of $\operatorname{Sym}^2C$ embeds, which opens the way to embedding higher symmetric powers. Cool stuff!
