  <li><p><a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/huybrech/CubicPaperAnUpdate.pdf">Daniel Huybrechts: The K3 category of a cubic fourfold &ndash; an update</a> is a survey written on the occasion of the Compositio prize which was awarded for the paper <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3705236">The K3 category of a cubic fourfold</a>. Highly recommended if you care about (or wish to be convinced about) understanding cubic fourfolds!
    <p>I can also tell you that there is a little work-in-progress coming up real soon, which was directly inspired by this survey article. Stay tuned!
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08142v1">Burt Totaro: Bott vanishing for Fano 3-folds</a> was already discussed in <a href="{% post_url 2023-02-16-fortnightly-links-165 %}">the previous blogpost</a>, but it deserves a spot in the fortnightly links too. Let me in particular advertise the quote
    <blockquote>
      We can view them as a generalization of toric Fano varieties; they should have some kind of combinatorial classification.
    </blockquote>
    <p>I look forward to seeing this classification solved!
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05751">Antonella Grassi, Giulia Gugiatti, Wendelin Lutz, Andrea Petracci: Reflexive polygons and rational elliptic surfaces</a> is an expository and very fun-to-read note on mirror symmetry for del Pezzo surfaces.
