<p>Last week Burt Totaro uploaded the preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08142v1">Bott vanishing for Fano 3-folds</a> to the arXiv, after earlier having studied Bott vanishing for del Pezzo surfaces. The results are now <a href="https://www.fanography.info/bott">Fanography.info</a>. More below the fold.
<hr>
<p>
<p>We say that <strong>Bott vanishing holds</strong> for a smooth projective variety $X$ if $\mathrm{H}^j(X,\Omega_X^i\otimes\mathcal{L})=0$ for all $j\geq 1$, $i\geq 0$ and $\mathcal{L}\in\operatorname{Pic}(X)$ <em>ample</em>. This is a curious property, that we don't understand very well yet:
<ul>
  <li>it holds for toric Fano varieties
  <li>for a Fano variety it implies $X$ is rigid, thus there are only finitely many Fano varieties in each dimension satisfying Bott vanishing
</ul>
<p>These two properties suggest there might be some combinatorial classification, as alluded to by Burt, but I don't think anyone has a good idea here? More on Bott vanishing:
<ul>
  <li>it is expected to fail for every partial flag variety $G/P$ which is not $\mathbb{P}^n$ (see more in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09414">Hochschild cohomology of generalised Grassmannians</a>)
  <li>the most curious thing from Totaro's paper is that it is possible that $X$ does not satisfy Bott vanishing, but the blowup of $X$ in some subvariety $Y$ does!
</ul>
<p>Now that your interest is piqued, go take a look at the <a href="https://www.fanography.info/bott">table of all Fano 3-folds satisfying Bott vanishing</a>!
