<p>The previous such post is only a few months old,
but here is another position!
<p>Utrecht University is hiring an <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/working-at-utrecht-university/jobs/assistant-professor-in-pure-mathematics"><strong>assistant professor in pure mathematics</strong></a>, not tied to specific area.
I can attest it is a great place to work, so if you fit the (broad) profile, and would like to work at Utrecht University,
please consider applying!
<p>If you have questions, you can ask me, or in case of more official questions, the head of the committee, which is <a href"https://sites.google.com/site/gijsheuts/home">Gijs Heuts</a>.
