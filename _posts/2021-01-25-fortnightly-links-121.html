  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYRR0SgbYH59htIHkwTbqMw">Math-life balance</a> is a brand new YouTube channel, for which <a href="https://www.muramatik.com">Maria Yakerson</a> interviews mathematicians. The first one is with <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zakh/">Inna Zakharevich</a>, and it's a really interesting watch, and different from usual interviews with mathematicians in a very good way!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04404v1">Alberto Canonaco, Amnon Neeman, Paolo Stellari: Uniqueness of enhancements for derived and geometric categories</a> proves uniqueness of enhancements of derived categories of abelian categories, for <em>all of them</em>. And what's more, they also deal with the "unseparated derived category" of a Grothendieck abelian category, which one can also call "the homotopy category of injectives". So then the intriguing thing happens that there is a recollement involving the derived category, the homotopy category of injectives and the singularity category, where the latter does not have a unique enhancement, but the other two do. Cool!

  <li><p><a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/formalising-mathematics-an-introduction/">Formalising mathematics</a> is the course introduction for a course taught by Kevin Buzzard on formalising mathematics in Lean. The <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/01/24/formalising-mathematics-workshop-1/">workshop</a> is also online already, guiding you through the first steps in Lean.
