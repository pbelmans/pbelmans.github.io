  <li><p><a href="https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1112/blms.12429">Amnon Neeman: New progress on Grothendieck duality, explained to those familiar with category theory and with algebraic geometry</a> has a self-explanatory title. I approve of the title, and the content of the paper, as it beautifully describes aspects one of my first loves in mathematics.

  <li><p>With the notion of a blogroll gone out of fashion for many, many years by now, I can amplify <a href="https://picturethismaths.wordpress.com">Picture This Maths</a> via these fortnightly links. They write very visually attractive blog posts!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14371">Christian BÃ¶hning, Hans-Christian Graf von Bothmer, Roberto Pignatelli: A rigid, not infinitesimally rigid surface with K ample</a> has another self-explanatory title. What is unfortunate is that we can't add it to <a href="https://superficie.info">superficie.info</a>, because $\mathrm{c}_1^2=1260966$ and $\mathrm{c}_2=560658$ is slightly out of what we can display!
