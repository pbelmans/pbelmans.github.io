<p>I am pleased and honoured to announce that I have joined the editorial board of <a href="https://ems.press/journals/jncg">Journal of Noncommutative Geometry</a>.
The word <em>algebraic</em> is implicit in its name,
as the journal serves both the NCG and NCAG communities.

<p>Please submit your interesting and high-quality papers on noncommutative algebraic geometry,
so that the journal can continue its role as a leading journal
in this particular niche!
