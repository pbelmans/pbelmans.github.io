<p>Last week I talked about how the Hodge diamond cutter now deals with horospherical varieties of rank 1. Now I've also implemented their properties for <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info">Grassmannian.info</a>, see the <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/horospherical">overview table</a>. Even though they are not homogeneous varieties, their geometry is so close to them that it makes sense to include them.
<p>A <em>horospherical</em> variety $X$ is a variety with an action by a reductive group $G$, such that $X$ has a dense $B$-orbit (where $B$ is a Borel subgroup), and if we let $H$ denote the stabiliser of a point in this dense orbit, then $H$ contains a conjugate of the maximal unipotent subgroup of $G$ inside $B$. In other words: we don't let $B$ act completely transitively, but 
<p>There exists an interesting geometric classification in the case of rank 1 by <a href="http://www-math.sp2mi.univ-poitiers.fr/~bpasquie/">Pasquier</a>, and this classification together with some of the geometric properties of these varieties is now available. I'm still working on the quantum spectrum, and I hope I haven't made any silly mistakes.
