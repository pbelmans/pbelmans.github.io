<p>Continuing the series of blogposts on Hodge numbers of interesting varieties and ways of computing them, we have arrived at partial flag varieties. Previously we have also computed
<ul>
  <li><a href="{% post_url 2017-06-14-dimensions-of-partial-flag-varieties %}">their dimensions</a>
  <li><a href="{% post_url 2018-08-22-rank-flag-varieties %}">the ranks of their Grothendieck groups</a>
  <li><a href="{% post_url 2018-08-23-index-partial-flag-varieties %}">their indices</a>
</ul>
<p>For the Hodge numbers of $G/P$ it is known that
<ul>
  <li>they are concentrated on the diagonal, i.e. only the $\mathrm{h}^{p,p}$ are nonzero
  <li>each cohomology space $\mathrm{H}^i(X,\mathbb{C})$ is generated by Schubert cells
</ul>
<p>It is therefore enough to enumerate the Schubert cells, and determine their dimensions. Recall that the parabolic subgroup $P$ is determined up to conjugation by specifying which roots one wishes to include, and one obtains the subgroup $W_P$ of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$ generated by those simple reflections.
<p>One then has to compute the cosets of $W_P$ in $W$, and determine the shortest element in each class. The Schubert cells correspond to these cosets, and their dimension is the length of the shortest element. Hence the following code gives the diagonal of the Hodge diamond.

def partial_flag_variety(D, I):
  """Hodge diamond of a partial flag variety G/P

  This is computed by counting the number of Schubert cells in the appropriate dimension

  Keyword arguments:
  D -- Dynkin type
  I -- indices of vertices to be omitted in defining the parabolic subgroup
  """
  W = WeylGroup(D)

  cosets = set([w.coset_representative(index_set=I) for w in W])
  lengths = [len(w.reduced_word()) for w in cosets]
  d = max(lengths)

  diagonal = [0]*(d + 1)

  for i in range(d + 1):
    diagonal[i] = len([l for l in lengths if l == i])

  return diagonal

print(partial_flag_variety("A3", [1, 2])) # this is just P^3
print(partial_flag_variety("B3", [1, 3]))
print(partial_flag_variety("C4", [1, 3, 4]))

<p>A little while ago I said I might combine all these Hodge diamond related snippets. I have done so, and I'll discuss that a little later.
