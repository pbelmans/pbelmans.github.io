<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/algebraic_geometry/Scheme.html">Schemes in mathlib</a>: Lean is a theorem prover; a piece of software that allows you to formalise mathematical objects and statements about them, whilst mathlib is a big library of such objects and results. And now schemes are a thing in Lean + mathlib! <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html">Many more things</a> are also a thing in mathlib, but somehow the formalisation of schemes feels special.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05516">Hunter Dinkins: Symplectic Duality of $\mathrm{T}^*\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$</a> has a nice introduction to 3d mirror symmetry (or symplectic duaity), which made me have a small click when it comes to this subject. It might help you in getting a similar click (or maybe you are much deeper into this subject already).
