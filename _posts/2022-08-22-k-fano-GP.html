<p>Fano varieties are varieties satisfying a positivity criterion.
Higher Fano varieties are varieties satisfying a <em>stronger</em> positivity criterion.
There is a hierarchy of $k$-Fanoness, with $k=1$ being the usual condition that the anticanonical bundle is ample.
For general $k$, one asks that $\mathrm{ch}_i(\mathrm{T}_X)\cdot Z>0$ for all effective codimension-$i$ cycles and all $i=1,\ldots,k$.
<p>For the wonderful properties that $k$-Fano varieties satisfy I refer you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02339">Carolina Araujo, Roya Beheshti, Ana-Maria Castravet, Kelly Jabbusch, Svetlana Makarova, Enrica Mazzon, Libby Taylor, Nivedita Viswanathan: Higher Fano manifolds</a>.
<p>This paper also classifies the generalised Grassmannians for which $k\geq 2$. In those cases $k=2$ except for projective spaces and sufficiently high-dimensional quadrics. So it is a really strong positivity criterion. See Theorem 1.3 for the classification.
<p>This post mostly serves to announce that this information is now also contained in <a href="https://grassmannian.info">Grassmannian.info</a>, both on the main page and on the detail pages. Thanks to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/enrica-mazzon/">Enrica Mazzon</a> for interesting discussions!
