<p>It's not a secret to anyone reading my blog that I like making mathematical websites, and over the past days I've had some more fun on my current project: <strong><a href="https://www.grassmannian.info">Grassmannian.info</a></strong>
<ul>
  <li>a page dedicated to Freudenthal's magic square and its role in projective geometry (see Landsberg&ndash;Manivel, [<a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1832903">MR1832903</a>])
  <li>a page for each root system, containing the data found in e.g. Bourbaki's appendix (this is not yet complete though, I need to sit down and decide how to present some of the data)
  <li>all but the data on projective embeddings is generated on the spot, so if for some reason you care about $\mathrm{OGr}(12,32)$ you <em>could</em> get information on that (but the system is not meant to be 100% robust yet, so you will likely get an error if you try)
</ul>
<p>The big thing missing is of course some explanation for all the data which is there. Also, do you have suggestions, requests or comments? Please get in touch!
