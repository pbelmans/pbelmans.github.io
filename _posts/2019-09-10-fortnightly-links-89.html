<p>The last edition of fortnightly links was more an edition of monthly links it turns out, but we are back in business now.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10986">Matteo Altavilla, Marin Petkovic, Franco Rota: Moduli spaces on the Kuznetsov component of Fano threefolds of index 2</a> (im)proves a categorical Torelli theorem for the Kuznetsov component in the <a href="https://www.fanography.info/1-12">del Pezzo 3-fold of degree 2</a>, by explaining the geometry of moduli spaces of Bridgeland-stable objects in the Kuznetsov component.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03005">Michael Wong: Dimer models and Hochschild cohomology</a> is a really interesting preprint, and its preliminaries are a very good introduction to the theory of dimer models. Highly recommended reading.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08405">Pamela E. Harris, Marissa Loving, Juan Ramirez, Joseph Rennie, Gordon Rojas Kirby, Eduardo Torres Davila, Fabrice O. Ulysse: Visualizing the support of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula for the rank two Lie algebras</a> contains some marvellous visualisations of weight multiplicities for representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$, $\mathfrak{so}_4$, $\mathfrak{so}_5$, $\mathfrak{sp}_4$ and $\mathfrak{g}_2$.
</ul>
