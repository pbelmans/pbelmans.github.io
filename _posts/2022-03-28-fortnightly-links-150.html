  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13150v1">Indranil Biswas, Chandranandan Gangopadhyay, Ronnie Sebastian: Infinitesimal deformations of some Quot schemes</a> computes the sheaf cohomology of the tangent bundle on a variety (and thus the infinitesimal information in the deformation theory of Quot schemes). The deformation theory of the curve and the vector bundle (and the value of the degree) appears in an interesting way in $\mathrm{h}^i(\mathcal{Q},\mathrm{T}_{\mathcal{Q}})$. Cool!
  <li><p><a href="https://www.c82.net/blog/?id=88">Making of Iconographic Encylop√¶dia</a> is a beautiful summary of the creation process of a historic illustrated encyclopedia, including mathematics. I absolutely adore these mixtures of graphical and user interface design, and I hope you can also enjoy them.
