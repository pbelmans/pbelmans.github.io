<p>This will likely be the last post for 2020. Thank you all for reading, and see you in 2021!
<p>If you are impatient: check out <a href="https://fanography.pythonanywhere.com/zero-section"><strong>the big table</strong></a>.

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13382">Fano 3-folds from homogeneous vector bundles over Grassmannians</a> De Biase&ndash;Fatighenti&ndash;Tanturri obtained a description of a general member of each deformation family of Fano 3-folds as the zero locus of a homogeneous vector bundle in a product of Grassmannians and weighted projective spaces. Such description gives new tools to compute cohomological invariants of Fano 3-folds (by virtue of the Borel&ndash;Weil&ndash;Bott theorem), and gives a representation-theoretic flavour to the classification.
<p>I wanted to add this information to Fanography, and I have finally done so now. Your patience will be rewarded by visiting <a href="https://fanography.pythonanywhere.com/zero-section"><strong>the big table</strong></a>.
<p>There could be some follow-up discussion on this description, but for now this is the end of the service announcement.
