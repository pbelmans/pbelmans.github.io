  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13864">Chunyi Li, Laura Pertusi, Xiaolei Zhao: Derived categories of hearts on Kuznetsov components</a> answers a natural question when one knows both of Bridgeland stability conditions (which involves t-structures, and thus abelian categories) and the Beilinson's realisation functor (which gives a functor from the derived category of the heart of a t-structure to the original triangulated category). Namely: is it an equivalence in interesting settings? This came up originally in the setting of perverse sheaves, but makes perfect sense in the setting of stability conditions too.
    <p>This preprint covers the case of K3 categories in cubic fourfolds or Gushel&ndash;Mukai varieties, showing that there is indeed an abelian category (namely the heart of a stability condition on the Kuznetsov component) for which this abstractly constructed triangulated category is indeed the derived category. Cool!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11518">Giovanni Staglian√≤: Explicit computations with cubic fourfolds, Gushel-Mukai fourfolds, and their associated K3 surfaces</a> discusses a Macaulay2 package to work with K3 surfaces associated to cubic fourfolds and Gushel&ndash;Mukai varieties (staying in the theme of the previous link). It's great to see this interplay between Hodge theory, algebraic geometry and computer algebra.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03548">Peter Spacek, Charles Wang: Towards Landau-Ginzburg models for cominuscule spaces via the exceptional cominuscule family</a> constructs Landau&ndash;Ginzburg mirrors for the <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E6/1">Cayley plane</a> and the <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/E7/7">Freudenthal variety</a>. There is a lot to unpack in there, and it would be great to see exceptional collections (which we don't have for the Freudenthal variety yet!) mirror to exceptional collections in the Fukaya&ndash;Seidel categories of these mirrors.
