<p>Sometimes I am given a superpotential, for which I want to compute the relations in the associated Jacobi algebra. This is a straightforward procedure using the <em>cyclic partial derivative</em>, but I am known to make a computational mistake or two from time to time.

<p>So I quickly implemented a small script for this in Sage. I thought <strong><a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/superpotentiator">superpotentiator</a></strong> was a good name, and so this is how you can find it on GitHub.

<p>I discovered that using <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">Sage Cell Server</a> it is possible to include Sage-scripts on your website, so below you can find an interactive version of the code. The quiver is defined on line&nbsp;25, the superpotential on line&nbsp;30. There are no checks

<script src="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/static/embedded_sagecell.js"></script>
<script>sagecell.makeSagecell({"inputLocation": ".sage"});</script>

<div class="sage">
  <script type="text/x-sage">
# cyclic partial derivative of f with respect to the arrow a
def CPD(a, f):
  if len(f.terms()) > 1:
    return sum([CPD(a, term) for term in f.terms()])

  coefficient = f.leading_coefficient()
  term = f.support_of_term()

  result = 0
  for i in range(term.length()):
    cyclic = term[i:] * term[:i]

    if cyclic[0] == a.support_of_term():
      result = result + f.parent()(cyclic[1:])

  return coefficient * result


# compute the relations in the Jacobi algebra
def relations(w):
  return [CPD(w.parent(a), w) for a in w.parent().arrows()]


# algebra
Q = DiGraph({1: {1: ["x", "y", "z"]}})
kQ = Q.path_semigroup().algebra(QQ)
kQ.inject_variables()

# superpotential
w = x*y*z - x*z*y

print relations(w)
  </script>
</div>
