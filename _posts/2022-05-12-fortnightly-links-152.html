  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00553">Giulia Gugiatti, Franco Rota: Full exceptional collections for anticanonical log del Pezzo surfaces</a> takes the reader on a beautiful voyage through the lands of homological mirror symmetry for stacky (or singular) del Pezzo surfaces, the McKay correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2$, colorful pictures showing weighted blowups, the geometry of Eckardt points on $\operatorname{Bl}_7\mathbb{P}^2$, the structure of exceptional collections on the minimal resolution and canonical stack.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13646">Fabian Reede: Picard schemes of noncommutative bielliptic surfaces</a> discusses aspects of last remaining case of Picard schemes for Azumaya algebras on Kodaira dimension 0 surfaces, the bielliptic surfaces. Recommended if you like some interesting noncommutative algebraic geometry involving orders.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01391">Riemann-Roch for $\overline{\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}}$</a> reminds me of the $\mathbb{F}_1$-seminar Lieven ran in Antwerp in 2011 (or 2012?), where if memory serves me right we disussed how a good theory for $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ (or some compactified version) over $\mathbb{F}_1$ would yield an approach to the $abc$-conjecture. One can read more about this in <a href="http://matrix.uantwerpen.be/lieven.lebruyn/LeBruyn2013c.pdf">this article by Lieven</a>. Browsing through these notes, it seems that the essential ingredient is not quite Riemann&ndash;Roch, but rather Riemann&ndash;Hurwitz. In Hartshorne these are only separated by 5 pages, so surely the world must be getting close to a non-IUTT "proof" of the $abc$-conjecture?!
