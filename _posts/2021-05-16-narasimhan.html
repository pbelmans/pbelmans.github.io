<p>It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of Narasimhan. He had a tremendous impact on algebraic geometry, and moduli spaces of vector bundles on curves in particular, with a career spanning over 60 years. Just a few days <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05543">a preprint he coauthored appeared on the arXiv</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1393812477922607109">the prime minister of India tweeted about him</a>.
<p>His lecture during the VBAC conference in Warwick in 2015 on derived categories of moduli of vector bundles on curves was an important inspiration for many of my current interests.
