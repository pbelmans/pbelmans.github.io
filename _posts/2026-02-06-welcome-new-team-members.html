<p>It is all good to post job announcements,
but I've come to realize that it is also good to actually publicly welcome the people who have joined the research group!
<p>I am really glad to say that I'm being joined by
<ul>
  <li>dr. <strong><a href="https://yuki-mizuno728.github.io/homepage/">Yuki Mizuno</a></strong>, who is joining me as a postdoc for 3 years,
    working on noncommutative algebraic geometry
  <li><strong>Matthijs Holstege</strong>, who is joining me as a PhD student,
    working on quiver moduli and noncommutative algebraic geometry
  <li><strong>Javier Fernández Piriz</strong>, who is joining Karin Melnick and me as a PhD student (so joint with the University of Luxembourg),
    working on partial flag varieties
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to all the interesting mathematics that we will do together!
