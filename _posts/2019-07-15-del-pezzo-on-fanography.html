<p>I have just updated <a href="https://www.fanography.info">Fanography</a> to include also information about del Pezzo surfaces, see the <a href="https://www.fanography.info/delpezzos">big table of del Pezzo surfaces</a>.

<p>As is evident from say the pages for low degree del Pezzo surfaces, it is not quite complete nor entirely consistent, but I'd rather have it already online so that someone who wishes to volunteer can contribute instead of perpetually waiting for myself to finish inputting all the data.

<p>So if you have
<ul>
  <li>suggestions or comments</li>
  <li>the desire to input the missing data (e.g. about the automorphism groups for low degree del Pezzo surfaces, and their geometric descriptions)</li>
</ul>
please get in touch!
