<p>This update is concerned with
<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03303">Moduli spaces of semiorthogonal decompositions in families</a></strong>,
written together with Shinnosuke Okawa, and Andrea Ricolfi.
I already alluded to it in the previous post:
this paper has seen a significant update.

<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>Following a very useful referee report,
we have:
<ul>
  <li>streamlined the entire paper;
  <li>referred to the literature for étale descent of semiorthogonal decompositions,
    thereby getting rid of a characteristic-zero assumption;
  <li>included a second proof of the functor being limit-preserving,
    following a suggestion by the referee;
  <li>included the referee's proof for uniqueness of deformations
    (with the original proof moved to a separated paper);
  <li>everything now works in a general smooth and proper setting,
    so the standing assumptions are always the same;
  <li>we have expanded the discussion on our conjecture
    regarding the subspace of non-trivial semiorthogonal decompositions.
</ul>
<p>I believe the paper is much improved now,
so if you didn't like the previous version, you can give this one a shot!
