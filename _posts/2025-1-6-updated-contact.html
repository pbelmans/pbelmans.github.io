<p>Today is my first day (physically) at Utrecht University.
<p>From now on, please get in touch using <a href="mailto:p.belmans@uu.nl">p.belmans@uu.nl</a>.
My former University of Luxembourg address is no longer active:
it is their policy to not have a grace period or forwarding set up,
which is pretty inconvenient for any academic.
I am sorry for the inconvenience this will cause...
<p>If you find any out-of-date contact information,
please let me know!
