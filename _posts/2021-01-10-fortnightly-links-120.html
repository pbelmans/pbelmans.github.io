  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14158v1">Yujiro Kawamata: On the derived category of a weighted projective threefold</a> is a short note, constructing a semiorthogonal decomposition for $\mathbb{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,3))$. This <em>singular</em> threefold could be seen as the first (formerly) open case, whose singularities were outside the scope of earlier results. 

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01959">Olivier Debarre, Giovanni Mongardi: Gushel-Mukai varieties with many symmetries and an explicit irrational Gushel-Mukai threefold</a> constructs an explicit irrational Gushel&ndash;Mukai threefold (it was only known that a generic one is  not rational, but not a single non-rational example was constructed), by showing that the automorphism group of a certain Gushel&ndash;Mukai threefold and its induced intermediate Jacobian is too big to ever be the Jacobian of a curve of genus 10 (which it would have to be if it were rational, by the Clemens&ndash;Griffiths criterion). Great!

  <li><p>Some news from the Lean front: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02602">Schemes in Lean</a> discusses the various approaches that have been taken to define schemes in Lean, and why some are better than others. And <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/01/09/the-end-of-the-summer/">The end of the summer</a> discusses the progress Buzzard's students have made in 2020. It is amazing to see this!
