<p>More than 8 years ago <a href="{% post_url 2016-11-05-bibgetter %}">I created bibgetter</a>,
a tool that fitted perfectly in my workflow of dealing with bibliographies in LaTeX,
which is a combination of citing arXiv preprints, papers with MathSciNet entries, and a few other things.
I imagine that your workflow might be very different,
and maybe you are looking for something like <a href="https://github.com/alexrutar/mathbib-py">mathbib</a> instead.

<p>So, about bibgetter.
After the MathSciNet update a few years back it stopped working.
I had some fun earlier this month, and now:
<ul>
  <li>it works again! no MathSciNet authentication needed anymore! (yes!)
  <li>it also supports a central bibliography file, which you can <em>curate</em>:
    sometimes MathSciNet entries have issues,
    or you can create your own custom entries (e.g., the Stacks project is not on MathSciNet)
  <li>it is implemented much more cleanly than before
</ul>
<p>By no means do I think it is a finished product.
But as I've started integrating it in my workflow,
so can you, and if you find issues or have feature requests, please get in touch!
