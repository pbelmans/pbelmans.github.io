<p>Back in January 2019 I released the <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/hodge-diamond-cutter">Hodge diamond cutter</a>, a convenient collection of Hodge diamonds of smooth projective varieties and methods to manipulate them. It's been extended since, and any suggestions for things to implement are still very welcome!

<p>In the post-seminar conversation after a Zoom talk I gave in Hannover, someone brought up this software into the discussion, and <a href="https://www.iag.uni-hannover.de/hulek.html">Klaus Hulek</a> suggested I'd get a DOI for it so that people can cite it accordingly. I have now done this, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3893509" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3893509.svg" alt="DOI" data-canonical-src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3893509.svg" style="max-width:100%;"></a> for more information.
