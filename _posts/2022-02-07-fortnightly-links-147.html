  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10033">Kyoung-Seog Lee, Han-Bom Moon: Derived category and ACM bundles of moduli space of vector bundles on a curve</a> discusses one of my favourite questions (when is there an embedding of the derived category of a variety into the derived category of an associated moduli space of objets), and shows that there is such an embedding for <em>any</em> curve of genus $g\geq 2$, for the moduli space of stable rank $r$ bundles with fixed determinant of degree coprime to $r$. This result is the endpoint in a search for such an embedding, which started with $r=2$ due to Narasimhan and Fonarev&ndash;Kuznetsov. Great!</p>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01184">Thorsten Beckmann: Atomic objects on hyper-Kähler manifolds</a> is a wonderful paper on modern aspects of hyperkähler varieties, and it's hard for me to do justice to its various aspects. For a pedestrian like myself, the highlight is Theorem 1.9: there are no spherical objects on hyperkähler varieties of $\mathrm{K}3^{[n]}$ or $\mathrm{OG}_{10}$-type!
  <li><p><a href="https://news.columbia.edu/news/stacks-project-johan-dejong">This Wikipedia of Algebraic Geometry Will Forever Be Incomplete. That’s the Point.</a> is an article in the Columbia News about the Stacks project. Check it out, if only for Johan's dress choice.
