<p>It's not quite a new paper,
rather it is a new <em>appendix</em> (<a href="/assets/appendix-non-semisimple-kronecker-moduli.pdf"><strong>pdf of a standalone version</strong></a>),
to be included in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01101">A-D-E diagrams, Hodge&ndash;Tate hyperplane sections and semisimple quantum cohomology</a>
by Sergey Galkin, Naichung Conan Leung, Changzheng Li, and Rui Xiong.
<p>It is a short appendix,
in which we observe that one of the main results in the Galkin&ndash;Leung&ndash;Li&ndash;Xiong paper
is also sufficiently strong to deduce that
the small quantum cohomology of certain Kronecker moduli is <em>not</em> semisimple.
Here, Kronecker moduli is shorthand for
moduli spaces of stable quiver representations of the Kronecker quiver;
this class of smooth projective varieties has many extremely nice properties,
and many strong tools to study them.
<p>I refer to the introduction of the main paper for additional context
motivating the study of quantum cohomology.
Let me just point out that
<ul>
  <li>combining the Schofield and Dubrovin conjectures
    predicts that the big quantum cohomology should be generically semisimple;
  <li>special cases of Kronecker moduli are Grassmannians,
    for which the small quantum cohomology is generically semisimple;
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15987">Meng has shown</a> that the small quantum cohomology for the Kronecker moduli space
    for the 3-Kronecker quiver and dimension vector $(2,3)$
    (the smallest case which is not a Grassmannian)
    has generically simple quantum cohomology.
</ul>
<p>One can experimentally (using <a href="https://quiver.tools">QuiverTools</a>)
check that the obstruction from Galkin&ndash;Leung&ndash;Li&ndash;Xiong's Theorem 1.2
vanishes for many examples of Kronecker moduli.
But Markus and I noticed that it does <em>not</em> vanish for the following infinite family of Kronecker moduli:
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>
<em>Let $\mathrm{M}_{(2,m)}^m$ be the Kronecker moduli space
for the $m$-Kronecker quiver and dimension vector $(2,m)$, and $m\geq 5$.
Then the small quantum cohomology of $\mathrm{M}_{(2,m)}^m$ is <strong>not</strong> generically semisimple.</em>
</p>
<p>It's a fun, combinatorial proof, that fits in 1.5 page, so I won't comment further on it.
