<p>I am <strong>very</strong> excited to share the news that I'll be starting as an assistant professor at the <a href="https://wwwfr.uni.lu/recherche/fstm/dmath">University of Luxembourg</a> this summer. I'm really looking forward to start!

<p>
<p>Not entirely unrelated to the message above the fold, I'd like to advertise:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/17373">this postdoc position</a>, associated to <a href="https://math.uni.lu/scherotzke/">Sarah Scherotzke</a>,
  <li><a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/17307">these 3 PhD positions</a>, which can be taken up with 5 of my future colleagues.
</ul>
<p>Especially for the postdoc position: in case you wish to work on topics that Sarah Scherotzke is interested in, it could be useful to know that I'll be starting there too, given the overlap between our research interests.
