<p>This blogpost is about
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09811"><strong>Failure of Bott vanishing for (co)adjoint partial flag varieties</strong></a>.
If you just want mathematics and not some of the backstory,
you can click the link to immediately get to the preprint.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Bott vanishing is a very strong cohomological vanishing property
for a smooth projective variety $X$,
which says that
\[
\mathrm{H}^p(X,\Omega_X^q\otimes\mathcal{L})=0
\]
for $p\geq 1$, $q\geq 0$ and $\mathcal{L}$ an ample line bundle on $X$.
It is satisfied only for very special varieties.
Buch&ndash;Thomsen&ndash;Lauritzen&ndash;Mehta showed that
over fields of positive characteristic
it is implied by
liftability of $X$ modulo $p^2$
<em>including their Frobenius</em>.
<p>Without asking the Frobenius lifts along,
it is precisely the setting of the famous Deligne&ndash;Illusie paper,
and the lifting modulo $p^2$ gives the (weaker)
Kodaira&ndash;Akizuki&ndash;Nakano vanishing
\[
\mathrm{H}^p(X,\Omega_X^q\otimes\mathcal{L})=0
\]
for $p+q\geq\dim X+1$ and an ample line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$.
Every variety arising from characteristic zero admits a lifting modulo $p^2$.
This is the key insight used by Deligne–Illusie to give an algebraic proof of Kodaira-type vanishing.
<h3>Conjecture</h3>
<p>Varieties which lift together with their Frobenius
are <em>much</em> rarer,
because they must satisfy Bott vanishing.
In the case of partial flag varieties, Buch&ndash;Thomsen&ndash;Lauritzen&ndash;Mehta conjectured the following.
<p><strong>Conjecture (Buch&ndash;Thomsen&ndash;Lauritzen&ndash;Mehta)</strong>
<em>Let $X=\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{P}$ be a partial flag variety
which is not isomorphic to a product of projective spaces
Then $X$ does not satisfy Bott vanishing.</em></p>
<p>This shows that such partial flag varieties cannot be lifted together with their Frobenius morphism.
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>In the short paper that this blogpost is concerned with,
I prove this conjecture for (co)adjoint partial flag varieties
(see <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info">Grassmannian.info</a> for an overview of these varieties).
The (co)minuscule case was already established by Buch&ndash;Thomsen&ndash;Lauritzen&ndash;Mehta.
Note that this gives a new proof of the non-liftability
of (co)adjoint partial flag varieties:
recently, and using a very different obstruction,
this was established (for all partial flag varieties)
by <a href="https://doi.org/10.4171/jems/1063">Achinger&ndash;Witaszek&ndash;Zdanowicz</a>.
<p>The failure of Bott vanishing outside the (co)minuscule and (co)adjoint case
can also be related to an observation Maxim Smirnov and I made
about the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition
of Hochschild cohomology of partial flag varieties:
we conjectured it to always have some non-zero higher cohomology,
and we computationally verified it in many cases.
<p>The cool thing is that
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09727">Anton Fonarev proved exactly that</a>!
The preprint also appeared today.
So taken all together,
the Buch&ndash;Thomsen&ndash;Lauritzen&ndash;Mehta conjecture is
<em>almost</em>
settled for generalised Grassmannians.
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The method of proof is easy to explain.
Because of how I think of this problem,
I prefer to think about $\bigwedge^q\mathrm{T}_X\cong\Omega_X^{\dim X-q}\otimes\omega_X^\vee$,
where $\omega_X^\vee$ is ample.
It turns out that to prove Bott non-vanishing,
it suffices to twist everything by $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$,
so that the line bundle remains ample.
<p>The recipe thus becomes:
<ol>
  <li>write down the associated graded of the Jordan&ndash;Hölder filtration of the tangent bundle:
    this is annoying in general
    (although in the classical types B, C and D there is a nice description and this is what Anton uses too),
    and can be done on a computer on a case-by-case basis amenable to these types of calculations,
    but the (co)adjoint case allows for a really good description;
  <li>search for the smallest exterior power (which will depend on the Dynkin type), such that,
    when twisting by $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$
    you get a non-zero higher sheaf cohomology
  <li>prove that it is indeed non-vanishing.
</ol>
<p>For parts (2) and (3),
one can use <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/bott-non-vanishing">a computer calculation</a>,
taking care that the method indeed works for all Dynkin types,
and not just the ones that you happened to have checked computationally.
<p>Recently, Bott (non-)vanishing was studied by several other authors.
This prompted me to make this observation on the non-vanishing for (co)adjoint varieties
(which in some premature form dates back to discussions with Maxim Smirnov
when we were working on <a href="https://doi.org/10.4171/dm/912">Hochschild cohomology of generalised Grassmannians</a>)
available as a short article.
<p>The preprint contains full details, including an explicit construction for each type. Comments and questions welcome!
