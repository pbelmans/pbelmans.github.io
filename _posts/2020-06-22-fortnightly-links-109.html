  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07643">Dmitrii Pirozhkov: Admissible subcategories of del Pezzo surfaces</a> is a very interesting preprint. It's the first non-trivial case where we know that the derived category of a smooth projective variety which is expected not to contain phantom subcategories, actually doesn't contain any. Great!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06016v1">Federico Barbacovi: On the composition of two spherical twists</a> is an extension of Segal's result that every autoequivalence is a spherical twist, by showing explicitly how the composition of spherical twists in this setting works, given the non-uniqueness of the source category for the spherical functor (spoiler: the answer is given by spherical functor from the gluing).

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06101v1">Alexander Polishchuk: Geometrization of trigonometric solutions of the associative and classical Yang-Baxter equations</a> discusses how sheaves of orders (and sheaves of Lie algebras) can be used to construct solutions of the Yang&ndash;Baxter equation. This equation is studied in many different guises, and appears in many different areas of mathematics. The connection between the Yang&ndash;Baxter equation and 1-Calabi-Yau $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-categories was realised by Polishchuk almost 20 years ago, and in the current paper he discusses various explicit examples coming from noncommutative algebraic geometry which fit into this framework.
  <p>If your brain is wired somewhat similar to how mine is, this paper (and the references therein) might be a good introduction to the subject. I saw Yang&ndash;Baxter-y things before in seminar and conference talks, but the subject never clicked. With this preprint it did.
