<p>I am excited to announce that together with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sarahscherotzke/">Sarah Scherotzke</a>
and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nicolo-sibilla/home?authuser=0">Nicol√≤ Sibilla</a>
we are organizing a 3-day workshop
at the University of Luxembourg,
titled <a href="https://moduli-2024.ncag.info"><strong>Modern Methods in Moduli</strong></a>.
It takes place from Tuesday November 26 to Thursday November 28,
at the Belval campus.
We already have a great lineup, and some more names will still be added to it.
<p>We ask that everyone who plans on attending registers,
so that we can arrange the coffee breaks accordingly.
We have some funding for junior participants,
you can indicate that you need funding on the registration form.
<p>I hope to see some familiar faces there,
and I also I hope to meet some new people!
