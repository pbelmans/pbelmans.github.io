<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14307v1">Xander Faber, Jon Grantham, Everett W. Howe: On the Maximum Gonality of a Curve over a Finite Field</a> is one of these preprints that makes me as an outsider smile at the beauty of the mathematics that I don't work on.
    <p>They also mention an example of a pair of curves of genus 3 with non-polarised isomorphic Jacobians, but one of them being a plane quartic and the other a hyperelliptic curve. Fun!
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01383v1">Jürgen Werner, Simon Venter, Nicolas Addington: Small resolutions of special three-dimensional varieties</a> is the English translation of the first author's PhD thesis on explicit resolutions of 3-folds. This is a beautiful subject, and Werner's work made an appearance in what Thorsten and I did on homological projective duality for the Segre cubic.
  <li><p><a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/problemes-dans-les-topos/">Jon Sterling: Problèmes dans les topos</a> is not something I link for its contents, but rather for the infrastructure used. There exists a system that allows you to write mathematics and use a tag-based referencing system (like the Stacks project does) without the hassle of using Gerby. Another instance is Jon's <a href="http://www.jonmsterling.com/math/lectures/categorical-foundations.html">Foundations of relative category theory</a>. They're based on <a href="https://github.com/paolobrasolin/krater">krater</a>. The setup is very different from how one would use Gerby though, but it has the benefit of being something completely static and low-maintenance.
