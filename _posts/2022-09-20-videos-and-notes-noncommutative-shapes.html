<p>Last week we had <a href="https://nc-shapes.info">Noncommutative Shapes</a>, the birthday conference for Michel Van den Bergh. People seemed to have enjoyed the event a lot, so that makes me really happy as an organiser.
<p>I've now posted the recordings to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMfdlw1N9Ug_FYm6r0g6xPA/videos">Noncommutative Shapes YouTube channel</a>, and the notes (whenever available) are also available <a href="https://nc-shapes.info/schedule">from the conference website</a>. So even if you had to miss the event, you can still enjoy the great talks that happened last week, I'm really grateful to the speakers for doing such a wonderful job.
