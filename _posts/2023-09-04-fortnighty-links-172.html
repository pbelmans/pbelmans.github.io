  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06191v1">Ben Webster, Philsang Yoo: 3-dimensional mirror symmetry</a> is an extended version
    of a Notices of AMS article which isn't out yet (I think),
    in which the authors explain 3-dimensional mirror symmetry,
    which is also known as <em>symplectic duality</em>.
    I remember being confused several years ago about the relationship between 2d and 3d mirror symmetry,
    and whilst that confusion has been cleared up since then,
    this article was still a really interesting read!
  <li><p><a href="https://thosgood.com/sga/">A translation project for SGA</a> is what it says on the nose.
    It uses <a href="https://bookdown.org">Bookdown</a>,
    so it is not written in LaTeX,
    but rather some Markdown + LaTeX hybrid. Cool!
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08121">Hiromu Tanaka: Fano threefolds in positive characteristic I</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08122">II</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08124">III</a> (with Masaya Asai),
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08127">IV</a>
    is a sequence of papers covering <em>many</em> details of the classification of Fano 3-folds in positive characteristic.
    I will try to figure out what needs to be changed on <a href="https://fanography.info">Fanography</a>
    in order for it to cover the positive characteristic case too.
