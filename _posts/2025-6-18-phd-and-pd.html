<p>I am excited to announce two ways in which you can join my team:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/working-at-utrecht-university/jobs/postdoc-position-in-algebraic-geometry">as a postdoc</a>
    (see also the <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/26658">MathJobs link</a>)
  <li><a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/working-at-utrecht-university/jobs/phd-position-in-algebraic-geometry">as a PhD student</a>
</ul>
<p>The summary:
<ul>
  <li>Both are intended to start <strong>between September and January</strong> (or as soon as possible thereafter).
  <li>The postdoc position is a <strong>2-year position</strong>, with the possibility to extend it to 3 years upon positive evaluation.
    <br>The PhD position is a <strong>4-year position</strong>.
  <li>Both come with small teaching duties.
  <li>There is a really active research group on algebraic geometry in Utrecht,
    and the Netherlands is a great place in general for algebraic geometry,
    with many interesting activities.
  <li>We will start reviewing and interviewing candidates after the application deadline of <strong>July 7</strong>.
</ul>
<p>Both positions are funded by the <a href="https://nwo.nl">NWO</a>,
through the <a href="https://pbelmans.ncag.info/projects/catsincage">Vidi project CatsINCAGe</a>,
and thus are concerned with noncommutative algebraic geometry,
with a focus on
Fourier&ndash;Mukai transforms, Hochschild cohomology, algebraic stacks, semiorthogonal decompositions, moduli spaces of sheaves:
<ul>
  <li>For the postdoc position, experience with some of these is required.
  <li>For the PhD position, some exposure to these notions during your master's degree is beneficial.
</ul>
<p>All information on how to apply can be found on the Utrecht University job portal.
If you have any questions, please get in touch!
<p><small>Tomorrow I'll post about another PhD position, which is joint with the University of Luxembourg.</small>
