<p>I want to congratulate
(a little belatedly)
<a href="https://tbpi.github.io">Thilo Baumann</a>,
for his PhD defense last week
at the University of Luxembourg,
and the wonderful thesis <em>The geometry of hereditary orders and beyond</em>
that he has written.
The thesis will be available online at some point,
for the time being,
you can check out:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15230">Categorical absorption for hereditary orders</a>,
    a preprint which implements a really nice idea on
    how to view the derived category of an hereditary order
    from the perspective of categorical absorptions
    (as introduced by Kuznetsov and Shinder)
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07620">Central curves on noncommutative surfaces</a>,
    a joint with between Thilo, Okke van Garderen, and myself,
    accepted for publication in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society
</ul>
<p>The third topic he has studied in his thesis
are Brauer&ndash;Severi schemes of hereditary orders.
<p>Thilo was my first PhD student
(although university regulations prevented an official recognition of this fact)
and I am grateful for having been his supervisor.
Congratulations!
