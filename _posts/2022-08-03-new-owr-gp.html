<p>As already announced in an <a href="{% post_url 2022-07-23-newish-paper-3 %}">earlier paper announcement post</a>, I have written an <a href="/assets/owr-2228-belmans.pdf"><strong>Oberwolfach report</strong></a> on the series of joint papers with Sergey Galkin and Swarnava Mukhopadhyay on graph potentials and mirror symmetry for moduli of rank 2 bundles on a curve.
<p>If you are looking for something with more details than a blogpost, but less details than the introductions of the various papers, this might satisfy your needs.
