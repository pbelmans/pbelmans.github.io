<p>After attending an Oberwolfach workshop with <a href="https://people.math.umass.edu/~devleming/">Kristin DeVleming</a>
and <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/anne-sophie-kaloghiros">Anne-Sophie Kaloghiros</a>
where they helped me navigate the literature on K-stability for Fano 3-folds (thanks so much!),
the current state of the art can now be found on <a href="https://www.fanography.info/K-stability"><strong>the K-stability page</strong></a>.
<p>I will add more explanations to Fanography after my holidays, for the time being I'll just refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-stability">K-stability Wikipedia page</a>.
<p>I am sure I have made mistakes, and I'm sure I've missed recent developments. Please get in touch if there is something I can improve!
