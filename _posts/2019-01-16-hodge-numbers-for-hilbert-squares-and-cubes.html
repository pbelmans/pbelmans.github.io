<p>In my ongoing series of posts on implementations to Hodge numbers for interesting smooth projective varieties we have now arrived at Hilbert squares and Hilbert cubes. In <a href="{% post_url 2017-11-18-hodge-numbers-hilb %}">Hodge numbers for $\operatorname{Hilb}^nS$</a> I explained how to compute these for Hilbert schemes of $n$ points on smooth projective surfaces. When one looks at $\operatorname{Hilb}^nX$ for $X$ a higher-dimensional variety, these are <em>very singular</em>, <strong>unless</strong> $n=2,3$. These special cases are then called Hilbert squares (resp. Hilbert cubes).
<p>As before, we'll denote the Hodge polynomial of a smooth projective variety $X$ as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{h}(X,x,y):=\sum_{p,q=0}^{\dim X}\mathrm{h}^{p,q}(X)x^py^q
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{h}^{p,q}=\dim\operatorname{H}^q(X,\Omega_X^p)$.
<p>Then the game we are playing is to express the Hodge polynomial of $\operatorname{Hilb}^2X$ and $\operatorname{Hilb}^3X$ in terms of that of $X$.

<h3>Hilbert squares</h3>
<p>The Hodge numbers for the Hilbert square can be considered classical, using the description of $\operatorname{Hilb}^2X$ as the blowup in the diagonal of the quotient of $X\times X$ by the group $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ permuting the factors. One can show that
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{h}(\operatorname{Hilb}^2X,x,y)
=
\frac{1}{2}
\left(
\mathrm{h}(X,x,y)^2 + \mathrm{h}(X,-x^2,-y^2)
\right)
+
\mathrm{h}(X,x,y)\left( \sum_{i=1}^{\dim X-1}(xy)^i \right)
\end{equation}

<h3>Hilbert cubes</h3>
<p>For Hilbert cubes the description is more complicated, and the resulting formula can be found on page 507 of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1382733">On the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points</a>. Without further ado, here it is (with intentional overflow to showcase how
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{h}(\operatorname{Hilb}^3X,x,y)
=
\frac{1}{6}\mathrm{h}(X,x,y)^3
\\\qquad + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{h}(X,x,y)\mathrm{h}(X,-x^2,-y^2)
\\\qquad + \frac{1}{3}\mathrm{h}(X,x^3,y^3)
\\\qquad + \mathrm{h}(X,x,y)^2\left( \sum_{i=1}^{\dim X-1}(xy)^i \right)
\\\qquad + \mathrm{h}(X,x,y)\left( \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq\dim X-1}(xy)^{i+j} \right)
\end{equation}

<h3>Implementation in Sage</h3>
<p>No post about Hodge numbers is complete without a Sage implementation (it is the sole purpose of these posts), so here goes. It becomes clear that constructing the Hodge polynomial for these higher-dimensional varieties is becoming quite cumbersome in non-trivial cases, so this is where my little library of Hodge diamond related tools will come in handy. Stay tuned for that!
