<p>I am <strong>really excited</strong> to share here the news that I will be moving to
<a href="https://uu.nl">Utrecht University</a>,
starting from January 1.
I am also very much looking forward to integrating in the vibrant Dutch algebraic geometry community,
which I participated in as an outsider over the past 10+ years.
I will at the same time miss working in Luxembourg.

<p>Today it was also
<a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/102-leading-researchers-receive-vidi-grant">announced that I am the recipient of
  a Vidi grant</a>, from the <a href="https://nwo.nl">NWO</a>,
for a project focusing on noncommutative algebraic geometry.
I thank the NWO for the confidence they have in me,
and I'm looking forward to all of the exciting noncommutative algebraic geometry I will be working on!

<p>I will be announcing (most likely two) PhD positions and a postdoc position at some point,
probably to start in September 2025 or thereabouts.
