<p>There's no official posting yet, but here I can make a non-official post.
<p>There is a <strong>postdoc position</strong> available at the University of Luxembourg,
to work with me, funded by my FNR OPEN grant 'AdEMAR'
(<em>Ad</em>missible <em>E</em>mbeddings for <em>M</em>oduli spaces in <em>A</em>lgebra and <em>R</em>epresentation theory).
<ul>
  <li>It is to start <strong>September 2023</strong> (or as soon as possible thereafter).
  <li>It is a <strong>2-year position</strong>, with the possibility to extend it to 3 years upon positive evaluation.
  <li>It comes with minor teaching duties (on the order of TA'ing 1 course per semester).
  <li>It comes with a highly competitive salary, and Belval is a great place to work.
  <li>There is an active research group on algebraic geometry and representation theory at the University of Luxembourg.
</ul>
<p>I'm looking for a candidate with a strong background in some of these topics:
<ul>
  <li>derived categories of varieties
  <li>algebraic stacks (e.g. good moduli spaces, or variation of GIT)
  <li>moduli spaces of vector bundles
  <li>moduli spaces of quiver representations
</ul>
<p>The deadline for applications will be either <strong>December 31</strong> or <strong>January 15</strong>.
Precise details on the application procedure are yet to be determined.
<p>Please get in touch with any questions you might have, and please spread the word to anyone who might be interested.
