  <li><p><a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/vkr/369850047">Aleksandr Novikov: Lefschetz exceptional collections on isotropic Grassmannians</a> is a master thesis, constructing new full (and even Lefschetz) exceptional collections for isotropic Grassmannians. The case $\mathrm{IGr}(3,10)$ (so the parabolic associated to the middle vertex in type $\mathrm{C}_5$) in particular, although one might hope that the methods generalise to $\mathrm{IGr}(3,2n)$.
  <p>This also means that another box on <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info">grassmannian.info</a> now has a shading, when you toggle the exceptional collections view. Maybe soon (for some version of this word) all $G/P$ are known to have a full exceptional collection!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04907v1">Fabian Reede: The Fourier-Mukai transform of a universal family of stable vector bundles</a> answers a (not too precise) question I (and presumably some others) have had for a while <em>in the negative</em>. If $X$ is a variety, and $Y$ is a nice moduli space of sheaves on $X$, such that $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(Y)$ looks like it might contain a copy of $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(X)$ embedded via Fourier&ndash;Mukai functor given by the universal sheaf, does it actually do?
  <p>Examples of this behavior are moduli of vector bundles of curves and Hilbert schemes of points for surfaces (and higher-dimensional varieties if $n=2$) if the structure sheaf if exceptional. But Fabian shows that this (admittedly naive) hope was too optimistic, by showing that $\Phi_{\mathcal{E}}\colon\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathbb{P}^2)\to\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathrm{M}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(4,1,3))$ is not fully faithful. This is very interesting!
