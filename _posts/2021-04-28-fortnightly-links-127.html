  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid">Liquid Tensor Experiment</a> is the work-in-progress on Peter Scholze's challenge to formalise an important milestone theorem from his work with Dustin Clausen. See <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/liquid-tensor-experiment/">his guest blog post on the Xena Project blog</a>.
    <p><small>It's also a nice pun on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Tension_Experiment">a progressive metal band's name</a>.</small>

  <li><p><a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Grothendieck_Schemes.html">Grothendieck's schemes in algebraic geometry</a> is another update from the formalisation crowd, but now not from the Lean users (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(drug)">not this one</a>), and rather from Isabelle users. They've successfully implemented schemes and proven some foundational results about them. Exciting times!

    <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13331">Dylan Spence: A note on semiorthogonal indecomposability of some Cohen&ndash;Macaulay varieties</a> discusses the indecomposability of two flavours of the derived category (perfect complexes resp. bounded derived category of coherent sheaves) of singular varieties. For a Cohen&ndash;Macaulay variety the dualizing complex is a sheaf, and one can talk about its base locus. Dylan shows that the Kawatani&ndash;Okawa result for indecomposability of derived categories of smooth varieties with finite canonical base locus generalises to this setting, suitably replacing skyscrapers of possibly singular points by Koszul zero-cycles, which define perfect complexes with support a closed point. Cool stuff!
