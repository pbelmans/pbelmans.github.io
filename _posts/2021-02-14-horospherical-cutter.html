<p>Just a quick service announcement: I have now added Hodge diamonds for horospherical varieties, as discussed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05063">Gonzales--Pech--Perrin--Samokhin, Geometry of horospherical varieties of Picard rank one</a>. Maybe I should spend some time discussing their geometry, but this will be it for now, interested readers are referred to this excellent article.
<p>This is part of an effort to add horospherical varieties to <a href="https://grassmannian.info">Grassmannian.info</a>, even though they are not quite homogeneous varieties, their geometry is sufficiently close to warrant their inclusion in my opinion.
<p>The usual comment applies: feel free to suggest other varieties whose Hodge diamonds you would like to be implemented!
