  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03174v1">Dan Rogalski: Artin-Schelter regular algebras</a>
    is a survey on AS-regular algebras,
    the algebras responsible in noncommutative algebraic geometry
    for noncommutative projective space.
    A must-read for anyone new to the field.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13555v1">Hiroshi Iritani: Quantum cohomology of blowups</a>
    and
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03696v2">Hiroshi Iritani, Yuki Koto: Quantum cohomology of projective bundles</a>
    show that the quantum cohomology of a blowup resp. projective bundle
    behave as one would expect,
    under the mirror symmetry correspondence
    and the fact that we know Orlov's blowup formula and projective bundle formula.
    Really cool!
  <li><p><a href="http://miurror.stars.ne.jp/calabiyau3data/hodges.html">Hodge numbers for smooth Calabi–Yau 3-folds</a>
    and <a href="http://miurror.stars.ne.jp/calabiyau3data/primitiveCY3.html">Topological invariants for known smooth Calabi–Yau 3-folds of Picard number one</a>
    are two visualisations of numerical data appearing in the classification of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
    Really <em>really</em> cool!
