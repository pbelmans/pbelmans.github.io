  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09564v1">Xun Lin: On nonexistence of semi-orthogonal decompositions in algebraic geometry</a> gives an upgraded indecomposability criterion for derived categories of smooth projective varieties (and even some singular ones), which allows them to prove that $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{Sym}^iC)$ is indecomposable for $i\leq g-1$. That is a great result that I was hoping would see a proof soon!
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09193v1">Qingyuan Jiang: Derived categories of Quot schemes of locally free quotients, I</a> is a great (in content and size) preprint constructing semiorthogonal decompositions for many situations in algebraic geometry, which somehow involve a Quot scheme. This will certainly lead to interesting applications.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07814v1">Maxim Smirnov: On the derived category of the adjoint Grassmannian of type F</a> tops of a very semiorthogonal fortnightly links, with Maxim constructing a full exceptional collection for the <a href="https://www.grassmannian.info/F4/1">adjoint Grassmannian in type F<sub>4</sub></a>. Based on the methods I can hope that we see E<sub>6</sub>/P<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>7</sub>/P<sub>7</sub> (and maybe E<sub>7</sub>/P<sub>1</sub> and even E<sub>8</sub>/P<sub>8</sub>) being tackled soon too. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">may you live in interesting times</a> was cast upon me when it comes to this exciting question!
