<p>Half a year ago <a href="{% post_url 2024-07-17-phd-grace %}">I announced</a>
that there were open PhD positions on a <a href="https://math.uni.lu/grace/">Luxembourgish block grant called GRACE</a>,
but that at the time we were most likely not hiring anyone in a subject close to my interests.
That has now changed, with the <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/24824"><strong>updated posting on MathJobs</strong></a>:
there is a position available which is supervised jointly
by <a href="https://math.uni.lu/~melnick/">Karin Melnick</a> and myself.
<p>It focuses on the use of representation-theoretic methods in algebraic and differential geometry,
e.g.,
the use of equivariant vector bundles to describe zero loci on homogeneous varieties.
<p>There is a significant focus on computational / algorithmic aspects,
within this specific project and the greater scope of the GRACE project,
and you will be part of a larger group of students working on computational aspects
in pure mathematics.
<p>So, if you are
<ul>
  <li>interested in, and have a solid background in algebraic geometry and representation
  <li>a background in programming
</ul>
and consider doing a PhD on this topic,
please apply as explained on the MathJobs posting.
<p>The position is officially based in Luxembourg,
with ample visits to Utrecht University as part of the setup.
<p>If you have any questions, please get in touch!
