<p>This has been on the website for a few months now,
but I have joined the editorial board for <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uexm20">Experimental Mathematics</a>,
following the "reboot" led by <a href="https://kasprzyk.work">Al Kasprzyk</a>.
<p>Please submit your interesting and high-quality experimental papers,
so that the journal can continue its role as a leading journal
in this particular niche!
