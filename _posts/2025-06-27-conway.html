<p>Back when I was still in Luxembourg,
I used to supervise projects in the <a href="https://math.uni.lu/eml/">Experimental Mathematics Lab</a>.
For one of these projects, the students were tasked with visualising Conway's Game of Life in three dimensions,
by drawing each generation on top of the previous one.
I was inspired to suggest this
by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2hoRnFsmQW/">something I'd seen linked on Twitter</a>.
<p>Because the SageMath approach the students used ran into efficiency issues,
I decided to try implementing it myself using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3js</a>.
The result can be seen on <a href="https://conway.ncag.info/">conway.ncag.info</a>.
<p>As you can tell from the link,
and <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/conway">from the repository</a>,
I haven't fully finished the implementation:
there is no GUI whatsoever.
But it is in fact possible to draw <em>many</em> patterns:
it comes preloaded with all the patterns from the
<a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki">the Conway's game of life wiki</a>.
To use this,
one has to modify the URL,
e.g.,
<pre><code>https://conway.ncag.info/?pattern=13enginecordership</code></pre>
<p>loads the file <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/conway/blob/main/public/patterns/13enginecordership.cells">13enginerecordership.cells</a>.
You see part of the animation in this post.
You can find all preloaded files
<a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/conway/tree/main/public/patterns">in the repository</a>.
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>I don't have time to properly build a GUI around this thing.
But I think it could be a fun project for someone else.
The code is <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/conway">on GitHub</a>.
There are, of course, various Conway Game of Life visualisers out there&mdash;but
is this the first online, open-source version that does 3D like this? Maybe.
In any case, I had fun building it last year, and now someone else can take it further.
