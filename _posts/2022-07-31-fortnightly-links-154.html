  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09687v1">Yukinobu Toda: Derived categories of Quot schemes of zero-dimensional quotients on curves</a> gives the semiorthogonal decompositions predicted by the Bagnarol&ndash;Fantechi&ndash;Perroni formula for the class of $\mathrm{Quot}_C(\mathcal{E},d)$ in the Grothendieck ring of varieties (which you can play with using the Hodge diamond cutter, <a href="{% post_url 2019-07-08-hodge-numbers-of-quot %}">see the corresponding blog post</a>). Cool! The methods are really interesting too.
  <li><p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/mathlib-changelog/">David Chanin: Introducing Mathlib Changelog</a> introduces <a href="https://mathlib-changelog.org/">mathlib-changelog.org</a>, a beautiful change log for mathlib, where you can search how your favourite objects and results have been evolving.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14104">Mina Aganagic: Homological Knot Invariants from Mirror Symmetry</a> is a paper for the ICM proceedings, discussing a homological mirror symmetry point-of-view on knot invariants, using equivariant mirror symmetry for hyperk√§hler varieties. Highly recommended reading in conjunction with Catharina's ICM paper from the previous fortnightly links.
