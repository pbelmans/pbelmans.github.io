<p>In the post <a href="{% post_url 2023-07-06-new-paper-chow-rings-quiver-moduli %}">'New paper: On Chow rings of quiver moduli'</a>
I explained a conjectural identification between two varieties, for which we used our newly gained understanding of Chow rings to give more evidence.
<p>Shortly after posting it to the arXiv I got an email by Laurent Manivel,
pointing out that the zero section of $\operatorname{Gr}(2,8)$ makes an appearance
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/crll.2005.2005.585.93">Atanas Iliev and Laurent Manivel: Severi varieties and their varieties of reductions</a>,
and that it might be useful to prove the identification.
<p>And indeed, after reading up a bit, I realised that the proof of the conjecture can be given by
simply stringing together various results,
avoiding any actual computations.
Namely:
<ol>
  <li>The Kronecker quiver moduli space $X$
    is also the moduli space of bundles $Z$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$
    with $(r,\mathrm{c}_1,\mathrm{c}_2)=(4,1,3)$,
    which is of height zero in the sense of Drezet.
  <li>The moduli space $Z$
    is the image of the second contraction of $\operatorname{Hilb}^3\mathbb{P}^2$
    (the other one being $\operatorname{Sym}^3\mathbb{P}^2$).
  <li>The zero section $Y$ is the variety $Y_2$ in Iliev&ndash;Manivel,
    this might be clear from Iliev&ndash;Manivel itself
    but a detailed proof is given in Theorem 3.8 of
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.5802/aif.3131">Pietro De Poi, Daniele Faenzi, Emilia Mezzetti and Kristian Ranestad: Fano congruences of index 3 and alternating 3-forms</a>.
  <li>Finally, $Y$ and $Z$ are identified by Theorem 4.2 in Iliev&ndash;Manivel.
</ol>
<p>We will update the paper accordingly, but as Hans and I will be on (separate) vacations for the next few weeks,
I wanted to write this blog post
so that no-one is wasting time on a proof
if one is so readily available from the literature already.
Of course, if you have something else of interest to tell us, please do!
<p>I would like to thank Laurent Manivel for the suggestion, and Jieao Song and Fabian Reede for related discussions.
