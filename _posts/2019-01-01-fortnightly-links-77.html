  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09186v1">Olivier Debarre, Alexander Kuznetsov: Gushel-Mukai varieties: moduli</a> continues the study of Gushel&ndash;Mukai varieties (when they are 3-dimensional they are the <a href="https://www.fanography.info/1-5">Fano 3-fold 1&ndash;5</a>), with 2 earlier installments by the same authors. They show how two moduli stacks (one for the varieties, one for the linear data describing them) are related.

  <p>The thing that intrigues me the most is the generalised root stack construction they introduce, I look forward to understanding it better.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09550v1">Alex Chirvasitu, Ryo Kanda, S. Paul Smith: Feigin and Odesskii's elliptic algebras</a> rather is the <em>first</em> paper in a series discussing Feigin&ndash;Odesskii algebras $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$, which generalise Sklyanin algebras (where $k=1$). In the original papers by Feigin&ndash;Odesskii, dating almost 30 years ago, quite a few statements were left as exercises to the reader, or as conjectures, and they provide careful proofs for these.

  <p>Exercise for the reader of this edition of fortnightly links: what can be said about $Q_{4,2}(E,\tau)$? That is the first interesting case it seems (as $Q_{3,2}(E,\tau)$ is just the polynomial algebra in 3 variables). Presumably it must fit somewhere in <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3366864">Pym's classification</a>, but what is $X_{4/2}$ supposed to be in this case? The definition is left for a later paper unfortunately...

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06413v1">Hayato Morimura: Derived equivalence for Mukai flop via mutation of semiorthogonal decomposition</a> is an interesting (and short) paper which I found a very interesting read. In this paper a new and streamlined proof is given of the theorem that varieties connected by either a standard flop, an Abuaf flop, or a Mukai flop are derived equivalent. Sometimes a paper comes along at precisely the right time, and for me this paper came along at precisely the right time for understanding what higher-dimensional flops are.
