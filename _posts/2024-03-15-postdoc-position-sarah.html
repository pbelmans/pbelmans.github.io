<p>My colleague <a href="https://math.uni.lu/scherotzke/">Sarah Scherotzke</a> is advertising a postdoc position in derived algebraic geometry
on <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/24449">MathJobs</a>.
The focus is on derived algebraic geometry.
It is not inconceivable that you get to interact with me too,
given that Sarah and I lead
<a href="https://pbelmans.ncag.info/uni.lu/group">a joint research group on algebraic geometry and representation theory</a>.
<p>If you have any questions, you can email her,
or both of us (or just me, if you think I'm better placed to answer your question).
