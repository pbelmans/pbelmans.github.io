<p>I'm really happy to announce that we have a new paper on the arXiv: <a href=""><strong>On decompositions for Fano schemes of intersections of two quadrics</strong></a>.
The <em>we</em> here refers to my coauthors Jishnu Bose, Sarah Frei, Ben Gould, James Hotchkiss, Alicia Lamarche, Jack Petok, Cristian Andres Rodriguez Avila, and Saket Shah.
Here is all of us:

<p>This picture was taken June 2023 in upstate New York,
because the paper is a collaboration which started at the
<a href="https://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/2023MRC-DerivedCategories">Mathematics Research Communities: Derived Categories, Arithmetic and Geometry</a>,
expertly organized by Matthew Ballard, Katrina Honigs, Daniel Krashen, Alicia Lamarche, and Emanuele Macr√¨,
where I led a group of PhD students and postdocs on a week-long adventure ride
on Fano schemes of intersections of two quadrics.
One of the projects we were working on has now materialized in the form of this preprint.

<h3>Decompositions for varieties</h3>
<p>In an earlier joint work with Sergey Galkin and Swarnava Mukhopadhyay we looked at
<a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=4557892">how the moduli space of rank-2 bundles on a curve "decomposes" in several ways</a>,
the following 2 being relevant here:
<ul>
  <li>a semiorthogonal decomposition of its derived category
  <li>an identity in the Grothendieck ring of varieties
</ul>
<p>This has led to what is called the BMGN conjecture (with Narasimhan independently conjecturing the semiorthogonal decomposition),
which is now settled by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11951">Tevelev&ndash;Torres</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01825">Tevelev</a>.
<p>On the other hand,
the <em>very first example</em> of a semiorthogonal decomposition
was that of $Q_1\cap Q_2\subset\mathbb{P}^{2n+1}$, due to Bondal and Orlov,
where the derived category of a naturally associated hyperelliptic curve appears.
<p>It is possible to interpolate between this ur-example
and moduli spaces of rank-2 bundles,
by considering Fano schemes of linear subspaces on intersections of 2 quadrics.
For $Q_1\cap Q_2\subset\mathbb{P}^{2n+1}$,
we will denote these as $\mathrm{F}_k(Q_1\cap Q_2)$,
for $k=0,\ldots,g-1$.
For more on the geometry of these Fano schemes, I refer to our paper.
<p>But what should the decomposition be?!

<h3>Hodge numbers and conjectures</h3>
<p>To find out what the decomposition ought to be
we can use the <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/hodge-diamond-cutter">Hodge diamond cutter</a>.
With a bit of optimism,
<ol>
  <li>a geometrically meaningful identity in $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ on the level of Hodge diamonds
  <li><em>might</em> be arising from a decomposition in the Grothendieck ring of varieties,
  <li>which in turn gives an identity in the Grothendieck ring of categories,
  <li>which in turn <em>might</em> be arising from an actual semiorthogonal decomposition.
</ol>
<p>This type of optimism is of course not always warranted,
but it is exactly what led the BGMN conjecture.
So this brings us to what we did:
<ul>
  <li>we explained how to compute the Hodge numbers of these Fano schemes,
    by bootstrapping from earlier works of Chen&ndash;Vilonen&ndash;Xue:
    this is where we worked some magic with mixed Hodge modules;
  <li>we found a mysterious (to me) formula for the multiplicity of each component,
    which can be checked numerically to be the right thing
</ul>
<p>Throughout I've focused on the "hyperelliptic" case, where the intersection of two quadrics is odd-dimensional.
There is a parallel story for the even-dimensional case, which can be called the "stacky" case.
Here, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18058">Fonarev has obtained a conjectural semiorthogonal decomposition in the "maximal" case</a>,
similar to the BGMN conjecture being the maximal case, and $Q_1\cap Q_2$ being the minimal case.
<p>Our work thus describes aspects of the geometry of $\mathrm{F}_k(Q_1\cap Q_2)$ is
<ul>
  <li>for all dimensions of $Q_1\cap Q_2$, independent of the parity,
  <li>for all $k=0,\ldots,g-1$.
</ul>
and uses it to make some conjectures about these really interesting varieties.
If you're not convinced why these are interesting, just check out the previous installment of fortnightly links.
<p>Let me know if you have any comments or questions!
